            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Honourable the LADY <hi>Elizabeth Barnadiſton.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AT the Deſire of the Authors Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I prefix your Ladyſhips Name to a Treatiſe by himſelf prepared for the Preſs, and committed to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal at the motion of Dr. <hi>Bates,</hi> who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the brighteſt Luminaries now ſhines in his expected and deſired Firmament.</p>
            <p>The enſuing Picture drawn by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Intimate, will revive your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Bleſſed Mr. <hi>Cooper,</hi> who was ſo highly eſteemed by your Honourable Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and (among many other ejected Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters) no ſmall ſharer in the effects of her Beneficence, which ſhe exerted there not as a Boon to oblige the Needy, but for a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to that cauſe for which he ſuffered, and a juſt return to his occaſional Labours, whence greater Bleſſings were deſigned to
<pb facs="tcp:93499:3"/> herſelf and Family. But ſeeing the Subject treated of, <hi>viz. The Glory of the Saints Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> is that under the Power whereof you determine your Choice, bear your Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and direct your Actings, it would be vain to labour at a further Apology for this Dedication.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Deſign</hi> purſued by the high diſplays of Glory in this Book reſpect both Sinners and Saints.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sinners</hi> are concernedly perſwaded to enter into the way of Heaven, from a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction that the good there received infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely exceeds in Pleaſure, Honour, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; whatever can be found in a ſinful courſe. This part is ſo warmly and wiſely managed, that the obſtinate Reader muſt aſcribe his ruin to his own perverſeneſs; for this motive from eternal Rewards is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced with that account of the vanity and vileneſs of a temporal Bliſs, as muſt put any conſidering Perſon to the bluſh, who ſets up Earth as a Rival with Heaven, or takes up with a Portion in it, yea, though end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Miſery were not the Wages of that Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Yet aſſured this laſt will be found true, and that God governeth us, by <hi>fear</hi> as well as <hi>hope,</hi> the prudent Author deſcribes
<pb facs="tcp:93499:3"/> 
               <hi>Hell</hi> in a manner fit to terrifie the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from perſiſting in ungodlineſs, to their neglect of Chriſt and forfeiture of this great Salvation.</p>
            <p>The mind impreſſed with the proſpect of theſe two extremely different States he leaves neither under deſpair of recovery, nor yet under darkneſs what means he ſhould apply himſelf to: And therefore, he preſcribes the method to be uſed by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted, yet ſtill in a dependance on the Grace of Chriſt from the demonſtrated im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency of meer nature, and total want of human merit; and encourageth a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the ſaid method by full aſſurances that a diſappointment cannot ariſe from our fallen State as irrecoverable. But leaſt the miſtaken Preſumption of the Hypocrite ſhould fix his danger by a claim to Saintſhip, he faithfully ſtates the infallible ſign of the Heirs of this heavenly Kingdom, and warns againſt a conceit of ſafety before theſe be evident. The other part of his deſign is to fix the Eyes of <hi>Saints</hi> ſo upon this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and glorious Crown of Life, as thence to derive relief and ſtrength againſt thoſe endangering Snares, worldly Allurements, afflictive Sufferings, and tireſome Labours
<pb facs="tcp:93499:4"/> which will attend them in their Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; this he treats of as a Man <hi>firſt</hi> forced on this Subject for a divine compoſedneſs under his own exerciſe; and then from the experimented fixing &amp; tranſporting power thereof commends the ſame to <hi>Zion</hi>'s Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as effectual to make them happier even under Sufferings, than without them.</p>
            <p>It may be leſs proper in an Epiſtle to your Ladyſhip to mention the doctrinal points wherein this divinely heated Soul diſcovers much Light and Judgment. How accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately and ſtrongly doth he prove againſt the <hi>Antimonians</hi> the lawfulneſs of a Saints <hi>reſpect</hi> to the recompence of reward, the rectoral connexion between Goſpel Duties and Benefits; the neceſſity of Repentance in order to forgiveneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which I hope will be the more regarded from him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his opinion about Predetermination and the object of Reprobation is more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to them, than that of others of us be.</p>
            <p>Madam! a Book of which theſe are the <hi>Contents,</hi> muſt be acceptable to one, in whom ſuch Truths had an early regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Power, and can entail on Poſterity a great ſtock of Prayers ſent up by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and his Brethren, at the requeſt of
<pb facs="tcp:93499:4"/> the Lady <hi>Wimbleton,</hi> whoſe Death invites you to an imitation of her exemplary Life.</p>
            <p>Her Ladyſhip with the Reverend Author are now beholding and enjoying that Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in its fullneſs, the darker glimpſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſufficed to raiſe them above this World, and reconcile them to Death; yet were their preſent Station capable of a bluſh, reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on their low Apprehenſions, remiſs La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, ſcanty layings out, and faint long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for that Glory, would compel it.</p>
            <p>Its but a few moments, and our State is decided for Eternity, and the unſeen World ſhall be felt in its greatneſs (as well as reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) beyond our comprehenſion. Oh, what a change will the very Borders of it make in our Thoughts, advancing, cleanſing, and improving ſuch as are moſt ſublime and beſt, whilſt all others periſh which are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal falſe or fooliſh!</p>
            <p>That you may dayly proceed in a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for Heaven, by further evidence of title, and agreeableneſs of temper; that none of your Off-ſpring may come ſhort thereof by degenerating from their emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently pious Anceſtors; And that theſe uncontroverted Truths (which deſerved an
<pb facs="tcp:93499:5"/> earlier Publication as well as larger Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories than the time of Preaching them would admit) may be of ſaving uſe to them, and many others, ſhall be the fervent Prayer of,</p>

            <head>THE EPISTLE. Some <hi>Memorials</hi> of the holy <hi>Life</hi> of that Learned Perſon Mr. <hi>Joſeph Cooper,</hi> the Author of the enſuing Treatiſe.</head>
            <p>SEeing ſome Readers are better pleas'd with a Book, when they know who, and what manner of Perſon he was that wrote it, tho' it be excellent in itſelf, it is th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ght fit to prefix ſomething of the Characters of this Great and Good Man; both which Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles the Reader ſhall find made good to him, before he hath gone over many Pages. Great for his Learning, and acquired Abilities, Good for his extraordinary Piety, Modeſty, Sobriety, Contentment with his Condition, and other Virtues and Excellencies of his Mind and Life.</p>
            <p>It is not pretended to give a full account of his Life, which could not be done, but by ſuch as knew him <hi>ab incunabulis,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed
<pb facs="tcp:93499:6"/> with him long and intimately, of which ſort it may eaſily be believed there are few, if any, remaining: This Eſſay is by one that knew him well, but not long, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the help of his own Papers, from whence the main of this Intelligence is derived, he thinks he knew him thoroughly, <hi>intus &amp; in cute.</hi> I know the whole Life of ſome Men is not worth the writing, or reading: If their Lives or Epitaphs were ſet in a true Light, it were better they were written up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Duſt, or Dirt, than engraven on Marble or Braſs, or Printed on Paper, I mean ſuch whoſe Atheiſm and Debaucheries have ſo corrupted their putrified Memories, that no Balſams, nor balmy words can turn them into Mummy. Yea, there are ſome good Men that have behaved themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably well in the World, yet having done nothing extraordinary to recommend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for ſomething of example and imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 'tis better to let them ſleep quietly in their Graves, than raiſe them up for nothing but to be ſeen.</p>
            <p>This doth not hinder, but that Men of rare Parts and Abilities may be ſhew'd to the World; however, of obſcure and unpromiſing Beginnings; yea, tho' their Candle burned
<pb facs="tcp:93499:6"/> in ſome obſcure Village, and therefore cou'd not much be taken notice of, yet may their illuſtrious Reputation, like a Lamp that burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or a Beacon upon an Hill, be expoſed for the benefit of this dark World. It's true, ſuch as <hi>Diogenes Laertius, Plutarch, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius Nepos,</hi> and our Learned <hi>Stanley,</hi> give us an account of Kings, great Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers and Stateſmen: But in the Holy Scriptures, we have the Life and Sermons of poor <hi>Jeremy,</hi> of a Neat-heard, <hi>Amos,</hi> of induſtrious Shepherds and mean Fiſhermen.</p>
            <p>This Mr. <hi>Joſeph Cooper</hi> was the Son of Mr. <hi>Hugh Cooper</hi> a Miniſter of the Goſpel at <hi>Preſton</hi> in <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> and was born in the Year <hi>1635.</hi> Of the firſt Septenary of his Life, himſelf ſaith, he could ſay nothing, of the two next he was ſorry he cou'd ſay ſo much. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith it all in a few words, Childhood and Youth are vanity, that it is an Age obnoxious to Vice and Miſcarriages. So about the 20th. Year of his Age, neceſſity drave him to take up with that ſort of Life, which is the leaſt fit for Study of any other, to wit of a School-maſter, at <hi>Clarely-home</hi> in the ſame County: Where not long after he began to preach.</p>
            <p>When his Life was half gon he began to live
<pb facs="tcp:93499:7"/> the Life of a Man, and of a Chriſtian; how he came to take up, and leave theſe terrene Vanities, and Wickedneſſes, himſelf will tell us by and by. Now with unwearied dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, he fell to his Studies, and in about Ten or Twelve Years Time made himſelf Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of much uſeful Learning.</p>
            <p>At firſt he obſerved a good ſtile in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Tongue, having read diverſe of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Maſters of it, as <hi>Livy, Tully,</hi> and other <hi>Claſſic</hi> Authors.</p>
            <p>Then he became very well skilled in the Greek-tongue, eſpecially ſuch as concerned Chriſtian Religion, its Rites, Uſages, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hiſtories of it, which he learned from <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius, Ireneus, Euſebius;</hi> he maſtered the moſt knotty of them all, <hi>Clemens Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus.</hi>

            <p>But his chief excellency lay in the Hebrew Tongue, which he made ſo much his own, as to be able to write it: A Specimen whereof we ſee in his Dedicatory Epiſtle of his <hi>Domus Meſ. Clavis</hi> to Dr. <hi>Caſtle,</hi> where we ſee though he defends the Antiquity and neceſſity of Points in the holy Bible, yet he himſelf was able to read and write too, without Points. Points indeed, as he diſputes, are needful for to preſerve the Purity of a Language, and for
<pb facs="tcp:93499:7"/> young Beginners, but the Maſters of Language need them not, as we ſee in the very Girls and Cook-maids, that have learned to write Short hand without Vowels.</p>
            <p>There are many worthy Scholars even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Eccleſiaſtics,</hi> that have never look'd into an Hebrew Bible. Others content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they can read it, or if they go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the help of the <hi>Hutterian</hi> Bible to find out the <hi>Radixes,</hi> or by the Interlineary of <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> to render it into Latin, this is enough; he is a great Doctor and Rabbin that can read his Hebrew without Points. But our Author was not only a great Textuary, and well verſed in <hi>Plantin</hi>'s unpointed and porta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Bible, but took great Pains to compare Oriental Verſions with it, and eſpecially that of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> which any one may ſee he had throughly examined, and critically com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the Hebrew. He read the <hi>Maſſiah,</hi> and other <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Rabbinical</hi> Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as if they had been in Latin.</p>
            <p>In the 34th Year of his Age he publiſhed his Book which he ſtiles <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Moſaicae clavis,</hi> A Book which all that underſtand it muſt be thankful for, ſo long as there is a Bible, the Book which his Vindicates, and if his Arguments hold not good, we may
<pb facs="tcp:93499:8"/> have a Bible to another Senſe, yea reducible to any Senſe that wicked and ſpelling Heads ſhall fancy: A Book that ſhews him to have been a Man of much reading in various Languages, upon various Subjects, and judicious Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations. A Book that keeps the Field, and has ſilenced the Adverſaries of the contrary Opinion, no one yet writing againſt it, though publiſhed <hi>30</hi> Years ſince. A Book that has gained the Author reputation amongſt all judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Linguiſts, for which ſome have made enquiry after him, who he was, and where he dwell'd before he dyed; and ſince his Death, hearing he left a poor Widow and deſolate Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, have for the worth of the Man and the Book, relieved her and hers with a continued Penſion; of which ſort ſhe has reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate the Reverend and Learned Dr. <hi>Heskyt</hi> ſometime of St. <hi>Helens</hi> in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His preaching was obſerved to be ſo convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, (how forcible are right words <hi>Job 6.25.</hi>) and ſuccesful, that he was preſently ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of, and amongſt other places, the People in and about <hi>Moſely</hi> call'd him to be their Paſtor, a place noted for its meanneſs and obſcurity, in the County of <hi>Worceſter:</hi> It affords but <hi>20</hi> Nobles a Year in a dry Rent,
<pb facs="tcp:93499:8"/> belonging to the Chappel: But being a Peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, and out of the inſpection of the Biſhop, has always ſince the Reformation had an excellent Miniſter belonging to it, who flying from the laſh of the ſpiritual Courts for Non-conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, hid themſelves in this ſmall and unregarded living. At this time ſuch Men were better provided, and therefore ſome in the Town and vicinage, engaged to make up the living <hi>50</hi> l. <hi>per Annum,</hi> which they did for about <hi>2</hi> Years; whilſt they lived he could keep his Living; for on the known <hi>Bartholomean</hi> Veſpers he found an Act of Parliament (we know by whom procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) to reach him whom the Eccleſiaſtical Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon could not touch. It muſt be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that what theſe Gentlemen continued to give him, made up the main of his Subſiſtence, both when he was in and out of his place: Yet it muſt farther be owned that he, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his ſuffering Brethren, have had their Supplies from an unſeen Hand. It was the obſervation of one that is now in Heaven, that he and ſome others had carefully ſurveyed the County where they lived, which is one of the largeſt in <hi>England,</hi> and afforded as many Non-conformiſts as any, yet ſaid he, they all live, maintain their Families, pay their Debts.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:93499:9"/>
            <p>Its true, there have been others that have been as great Critic's as he in theſe learned Languages, but let the Reader take this along with him, that he got all by his own induſtry: He had no <hi>Maître de langue,</hi> ſaving what he had as a School-boy: He converſed only with the Dumb: Silent Writers were his inſtructors: By him a Man may learn what induſtry can do, and what Labour can overcome; beſides he did all this when he had the noiſe of diverſe little Children, Ten at the leaſt, a large Family calling for Bread, which yet his paternal Care, and God's good Providence, as was ſaid before, did ſupply: He was moreover all this while a conſtant Preacher, and which was more, an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, and followed Preacher; for our Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binnical Men are commonly the ſcorn of the Vulgar, they are better at Criticiſms than Elocution; they that remember Mr. <hi>Wheeler,</hi> Dr. <hi>Caſtle</hi> and ſome other ſuch like, know this to be true: But our Author as he was happy in the ſacred Criticks, ſo he ſought to find out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable words, <hi>Eccleſ. 12.19.</hi> and could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs himſelf <hi>ad captum populi,</hi> in his Mother Tongue, and with a certain kind of divine and winning Rhetoric draw them after him.</p>
            <p>He was no ſtranger to natural Philoſophy, nor the Mathematicks, nor yet to Medicin, in
<pb facs="tcp:93499:9"/> which by his ſtudy and converſation he had profited much: For he was an inquiſitive Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and learned greatly by learned Men, when he met with them. And by this means if God had bleſſed him with longer Life, he intended to have gained an Addition to his ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence.</p>
            <p>Yet all this Learning, Uſefulneſs, I might add modeſty, Humility, and forbearance to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with things not concerning him, cou'd not keep him out of a Priſon. Once he lay in <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi> Goal for the great crime of Preaching, yet had the Courage to preach the ſame day the Law releaſed him. At another time he was ſought after to undergo the ſame prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but God hid him, as we may verily believe: For being ſearched for by ſome Troo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers ſent to his Houſe on purpoſe, who not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, one of them more ſuſpicious and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent than the reſt, ſwore the uſual Oath, This fellow hides himſelf in the Chappel: Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he came to the Door; the Key was in it; he turns and opens, looks about him and goes back, without farther ſearch: But had he gon in he had certainly found the party he looked for, for thither Mr. <hi>C.</hi> had retired upon ſome notice of their coming.</p>
            <p>His care of keeping a good Conſcience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb facs="tcp:93499:10"/> God and Man may moſt evidently be ſeen in a Paper found in his Study, wherein he undertook diligently to ſearch and try his own Heart and Ways: A work that too few are acquainted with, how profitable ſoever it is: We ſhall exhibit this writing in his own words, when we have only told you, that his laying ſuch a heavy charge againſt himſelf is, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, according to Truth and a juſtifiable thing. The Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> (to whom our Author may in many things be compared, and whom he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, though <hi>non paſſibus aequis</hi>) doth the very ſame, calling himſelf, the leaſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, the meaneſt of Saints: Sin had wrought in him all manner of concupiſcence: Sin tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occaſion by the Commandment deceived him. In me, ſaith he, dwelleth no good thing. The good that I would I do not; when I would do good, Evil is preſent with me. I was a Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, a Perſecutor, Injurious. Wonder not then to find our Author expreſſing himſelf in ſuch words deteſting himſelf and his evil Courſes: But God had mercy on theſe two Men, who by his Grace became eminent Saints, and Preachers of his Grace: Who as before their Converſion they were exceeding vile and ſinful, at the time of its full of Pangs, and afterwards exceeding laborious for their
<pb facs="tcp:93499:10"/> great Lord, and Maſter: Add to this, that they both ſpake with Tongues more than many others, the one indeed by a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Inſpiration, the other by the bleſſing of God upon his induſtry: The one ſpared not his <hi>Corinthians,</hi> was afraid of his <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> wept over his <hi>Philippians,</hi> ſo was the other very zealous for his People, reproving freely, praying and weeping plentifully for his beloved Flo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>k at <hi>Moſely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to his Paper which he never thought ſhou'd have been publiſhed, but was reſerved for his private review and uſe: Becauſe it may do good, to excite others to the like examination of themſelves, and penning down their Experiences, Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and obſervations about their own ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Eſtates, it is here offered as an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, wherein he is as full in ſhewing his dark ſide as his bright ſide. <hi>I know a Man, whether in Chriſt or out of Chriſt, I cannot tell, ſuch an one I know, who believing an Eternal Judgment, and willing to ſtate the caſe of his own Soul, againſt that dreadful Solemnity, that he might the better underſtand what iſſue to expect, in the invinſible World.</hi> His Appetites were ſtrong and violent to all
<pb facs="tcp:93499:11"/> manner of Evil, neither did he reſtrain himſelf from any deſire of his own wicked Heart, but what the fear of Stripes, or when he grew to be bigger, the Fear of Hell reſtrained him from; yet here alſo where he durſt not adventure upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Act, he practiſed it all, and rioted upon it in Contemplation. You take too ſpare a meaſure of his Wickedneſs, if you ſuppoſe he proceeded no farther than Rioting and Drunkeneſs, Chambering and Wantonneſs, Strife and Envy, Sabbath-breaking and Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (which often was ſuborn'd to palliate all the reſt:) Imagine what you will forbidden, that falls within the compaſs of the Ten Commandments, he really, thinks that one way or other, he ſtands chargeable with it; beſides the wilful omiſſion of all affirmative Duties conceived in both Tables of the Law. In this curſed courſe was his Life, and ſo ſuitable was it to the Diabolical Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that dwelt in him, that nothing was more irkſome to him, than that which gave check to his compliance therewith. Which yet through the infinite Goodneſs of God, he ſometimes met with, ſuch as guilty Fears in his own conſcience, confounding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hame for all his unkindneſs to the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb facs="tcp:93499:11"/> God, whoſe Mercy had ſo long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented his Deſtruction in Hell; and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Conviction of a neceſſity of breaking off his Sins by Repentance, or periſhing which had ſome times ſuch a mighty force upon him as to drag him out of his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and from amongſt his evil aſſociates into the Garden or Field by Night, where he would furrow his Cheaks with Tears, ſolemnly vow and covenant with God, and yet break through all again into his former courſe; till at laſt he apprehended this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting and unfaithfulneſs in it, did but bind a far more exceeding and eternal weight of wrath upon him; with this he was ſo terrified that he durſt covenant no more. This courſe laſted from about ſeven to ſeventeen Years of Age, in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Corruption acted before he remembers not. After this time living an idle Life, and being travelled with bad Company, he caſt off his allegiance to Parents, and took a Wife before nineteen Years of Age, for which his Father juſtly caſt him off, and he wonders the holy God did not alſo caſt him into Hell. But contrary to his demerit, and to manifeſt that our heavenly Father can pard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n what earthly Parents cannot,
<pb facs="tcp:93499:12"/> God took him in, provided a comfortable ſubſiſtence for him, and without any ſeeking of his, fed this wretched Prodigal with Food convenient, that was ready to periſh upon a Dunghil. This kindneſs of Divine Providence conſidered, he could no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt; this brake his Heart in pieces like a Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheard, diſſolved him like Snow, melted him like wax before the Sun. Now his old Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions revived with more ſtrength than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and as a piece of pennance whereby to eſcape Hell and purchaſe Heaven, he could be content to leave his Sins, though ſtill the remembrance of them was grateful to his Nature; and he thought them a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Morſel, but that Hell ſtood at the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end of them. But he could have no admiſſion upon theſe unworthy terms; the Spirit of God falls to work with his Conſcience as in a voice of Thunder; and with terrors more dreadful than all that ever were ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized upon Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> ſingles out his delicate darling corruption, ſwallows him up into the confounding thoughts of it, reads the Law, charges Guilt and Wrath upon him, and thereby ſlew him; ſo that now he lies bleeding under reprobate aſtoniſhment, dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every moment when the Hand, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging
<pb facs="tcp:93499:12"/> Hand of God would caſt him into Hell. And ſo violent was the Agony that he thinks, that had not a gleam of Goſpel Light come in offering relief and redemption through the free Grace of God in Chriſt, that either Soul and Body had been torn aſunder, through the great violence of the ſtorm, or elſe he fears he ſhould have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed himſelf to avoid it. This notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he thinks he had ſome worſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, than what the Spirit of God now faſtned upon his Conſcience, as many a bad Lord hath Slaves worſe than himſelf, though they all pay ſuit and ſervice to him, as his other Luſts did to this <hi>peccatum in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciis.</hi> Againſt this therefore he bent his whole ſtrength, little conſidering for ſome Years the ſtate of his Soul, as to other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, which lay dormant, their General being ſo watcht that he could not command them out upon their deviliſh Service as he was wont. Yet the great thing minded was Pardon for a long time, with a reſolution not to gratifie it, though every denyal were a preſent Death. Having thus in time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſome reſt from his hard bondage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, and guilty fears gendred by it; he began to conſider the great happineſs of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
<pb facs="tcp:93499:13"/> over corruption, and to judge that what Poyſon, what Plague, what Death and loathſome Ulcers are to the Body, Sin is that to the Soul and infinitely worſe; which was all now ſet home upon him both by ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional conviction and his own doleful expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
            <p>This engaged him wholly to attend the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of mortification, but chiefly of this Luſt to cut off all proviſions from it, to deny its importunate cravings, and to maintain a conſtant watch againſt it, all which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he often received wounds and brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes by it. But having a little reſpite to examine himſelf as to other Corruptions, Death comes upon him again; he finds all manner of concupiſcence working in him; thinks himſelf a <hi>Babel,</hi> a <hi>Sodom,</hi> an Hell for all confounding and raging Luſts. So that had he not by this time better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood whence to fetch Sanctifying Grace as them formerly, he muſt have deſpaired. But he had now learnt to go to the Lord Jeſus, not only as giving Remiſſion of Sins, through Faith in his Blood, but likewiſe ſaving from Sin by the efficacy of his own Almighty Spirit. Hither he never applied himſelf in believing manner, but he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

So that there is no Poſſibility of finding out the way to True Happineſs at <hi>Athens,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Philoſophers, who ſought it only by Human Reaſon; but, in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> amongſt the Prophets and Apoſtles, Men, inſpired with Divine Wiſdom from Heaven; they will tell us the Truth, That our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſtands not in the Quint-Eſſence of Any, nor in the general Collection of All, Created Good Things; but, in the having of the Lord JEHOVAH for our Portion, and, our exceeding great Reward.</p>
            <p>MEN may Fancy much Happineſs, where Garners are Full, affording all manner of Store; where their Flocks are Fruitful, and their Oxen are Strong to Labor; where there is no Breaking in, nor Complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Streets: But, <hi>David,</hi> a Man after God's own Heart, by an holy Epanontheſis, Contradicts that groſs Miſtake, [<hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.15.] and ſtands like a Beacon upon an Hill, to give Aim at the Mark of True Bleſſedneſs; pronouncing that People alone to be Happy, whoſe <hi>God is the Lord.</hi> Let Men dive into the bottom of Nature's Sea, yet they will be able to bring up from thence, nothing but Hands full of Sand and Gravel; this One Pearl of Great Price, is no where Engendred in the Bowels of the Earth, When the Enquiry was; <hi>Where ſhall Wiſdom be found?
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:93499:23"/> and, Where is the place of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding? The Depth ſaid, It is not in me; and the Sea ſaid, It is not with me. [Job,</hi> 28.13, 14.] So, if the like Enquiry be made after True Happineſs, both Sea and Land, both the Riches of the Earth, and the hidden Treaſures of the Deep, muſt needs ſay, It is not in them. A Man having Crowns and Scepters, and Bags of Gold under his Feet, may ſeem to ſtand upon a little higher Ground than his Neighbours: But, for all that, if God in Chriſt be not his Portion, he is not one Cubit higher in the Stature of true Bleſſedneſs. The Truth is, we are all ready, as <hi>Samuel,</hi> in the caſe of <hi>David,</hi> to miſtake the Bleſſed Man, and to ſet the Crown of Happineſs upon their Heads, for whom, God never intended it; as <hi>Samuel</hi> over look'd little <hi>David,</hi> and would fain have Anointed <hi>Eliab</hi> King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſo goodly a Perſonage: But, we muſt not Meaſure Happineſs by Worldly Things; nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them Heirs of Heaven and Glory, who have the faireſt Portion of Earth, and Earthly Enjoyments. The Pen-Men of Holy Scripture, when-ever they go about to Decipher a Bleſſed Man, they never do it by his Outward Condition, but by his Inward Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; not by his Large Purchaſes, but by his Holy Practices; not by what he hath in Poſſeſſion for this Life, but by what he hath in Reverſion after Death. Hence it is, that you ſhall never hear any ſuch Words fall from their Mouthes, as to ſay; Bleſſed are they that are Rich. Bleſſed are they that are Mighty. Bleſſed are they that are Honoured before Men. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are they that have Gorgeous Apparel, and Fare Deliciouſly every day. But, <hi>Bleſſed are they, whoſe Sins are Forgiven them.</hi> [Pſal. 31.1, 2.] <hi>Bleſſed are they that Walk in the Law of the Lord. Bleſſed are they that Mourn.</hi> [Mat. 5.3.—11.] <hi>Bleſſed are they that Hunger and Thirst for Righteouſneſs Sake. Bleſſed are the Pure in Heart, for they ſhall ſee God.</hi>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:93499:24"/> A Man may have many Bleſſings, and yet not be Bleſs'd. And again, he may lye under many Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and yet not be Miſerable. Have all the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings in the World, yet without God, thy Condition is Miſerable: Have all the Miſeries that the World can inflict, yet ſtill, if God be thy Portion, thou art perfectly Bleſſed. 'Tis not what Men <hi>have,</hi> but what they <hi>are;</hi> not what is their Preſent and Temporal, but what ſhall be their Future, and their Eternal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that ſpeaks them to be either compleatly Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, or truly Bleſſed.</p>

Durſt I compare this Treatiſe with the Ark of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, I might tell you, there is laid up in it, both an <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod, and a Pot of <hi>Mannah:</hi> There is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Hell's Horrour diſcover'd, to Affright Men out of their Ungodly Courſes; and a Glimpſe of Heaven's Glory, ſuch as it is, to Decoy them into a Life of ſerious, practical Holineſs.

Such Men who thus deſign their own Profit, Honour, and Promotion in the World, by that pitiful Religion which they have, they are juſt like the <hi>Lapis Chelido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> which (ſay Naturaliſts) will retain it's Virtue no longer than whilſt you keep it inclos'd in Gold. The Upper Springs of Grace and Glory, which God always gives in Dowry with his Daughter <hi>Achſah,</hi> True Godlineſs, cannot make a Worldly Heart fall in Love with Her; unleſs God will give him the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Springs alſo, ſuch as Riches, Honours, and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Poſſeſſions, he will never be brought to Match with her; nor is the Match ever made ſo ſure upon this Account, but if at any time God dry up theſe Nether Springs, now the Stream of this Muck Worm's Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, will wholly fail, ſuch a <hi>Nabal,</hi> will God's own Daughter, (<hi>Religion</hi> I mean) find him, that he will be ſure to turn her upon her Father, not forbearing (ſo much as one Night) to thruſt her out of Doors. When the Ark came into the Houſe of <hi>Obed-Edom,</hi> and they ſaw that it brought a Bleſſing upon him and his whole Houſe, then every one (no doubt) could think it worth their Entertainment: But, when Judgments attended the Ark of God, almoſt every Man thought it a Burden, and by all means would turn it off, ſo that in ſuch a time, the Ark of God finds no Reſt; they ſend it from <hi>Gath</hi> to <hi>Ekron,</hi> from <hi>Ekron</hi>

Thus every Man will own Religion Proſpering, a Bleſſing Ark: But, where is he that will own Religion under Worldly Diſadvantages, that will entertain the Ark of God when Perſecuted, when Baniſhed, when Dangerous, and Un-doing to thoſe that meddle with it? How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Love of the World do thus eat out the Heart of Religion, with thoſe who have their Portion in this World; yet, certainly it becomes not you, Chriſtians, whoſe Treaſure is in Heaven, thus to have the Wayes of God in Admiration for Advantage ſake: Thus to Morgage your eternal Inheritance, to keep the poor Cottage of an earthly Eſtate, wherein you are but Tenants at Will. Their Condition, of all Mens, is moſt Miſerable, who go from Heaven to Hell: From the Heaven (I mean) of Wordly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, to the Hell of Endleſs Deſtruction in the World to come.

               <p>FOR the Dependance of the Words, we muſt know that if we look upon the general ſtate of this Chapter, wherein they have their place of reſidence, we ſhall find it to be an Apoſtolical <hi>Abridgment of the Old Teſtament,</hi> in that part thereof which is Hiſtorical, containing a Narration of the <hi>Heroical Atchievements</hi> of thoſe <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Worthies of the Lord,</hi> the excellency of whoſe Faith in the many eminent Fruits, and invincible Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of it, is herein left upon everlaſting <hi>Record,</hi>

               <p>AMONGST theſe <hi>Famous Worthies,</hi> of whom both Men and Women, our Apoſtle gives a particular <hi>Catalogue,</hi> as of Perſons made Glorious by the unblaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Fruits of a lively Faith, ſome have Renowned themſelves as Servants <hi>actively,</hi> by their doing and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to God; and others have approved themſelves as Soldiers <hi>paſſively,</hi> by their Magnanimous Suffering and Dying for God: But now <hi>Moſes,</hi> of whom my Text is ſpoken, ſtands fully intereſted in both Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, as having given ſufficient Teſtimony of his Faith, not only by what he did, but alſo by what he ſuffered; not only by laying forth his Life in the ways of God, but alſo by his readineſs to lay down both Riches, and Honours, and Pleaſures, yea, and Life it ſelf for the Cauſe of God. For, whereas, whilſt yet in his Non-age, he had the Honour to be called the Son of <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s Daughter, yet no ſooner did he come to Age, and arrive at the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               <p>WHEREAS he might have lived a Courtier, enjoying what Heart could wiſh, faring deliciouſly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, and glutting himſelf with all carnal Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, that either variety of melodious Sounds, and exquiſite Harmony, or gorgeous Apparel, or extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Luxury could poſſibly afford: Yet we find him bidding adieu to all theſe, and rather <hi>chuſing to ſuffer

               <p>THESE are the parts of the Text, the Genuine ſenſe whereof I ſhall give you in the explication of the Terms, labouring now to break the Shell, that ſo you may come to that ſweet Kernel of Goſpel-truth, which is wrapt up, and encloſed therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FOR he had reſpect.]</hi> In this Phraſe is implyed, that gracious Act of <hi>Moſes,</hi> whereby he had reſpect to, ſtedfaſtly fixing his eye upon, the recompence of the Reward, as matter of ſingular incouragement to deny himſelf for the Lord's ſake, in all thoſe Riches, Honours, and variety of carnal Pleaſures, which by

               <p>
                  <hi>TO the Recompence of the Reward.]</hi> That glorious Object, upon which <hi>Moſes</hi> fixing his eye, did ſo chearfully deny himſelf in all his worldly enjoyments, you have here expreſſed by one word in the Original, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſignifying ſuch a Reward, whereby a Man is Recompenced. This Recompenſe is diverſly taken, according to the Perſons to whom, and work for which, it is given. When to a wicked Perſon for an evil work, it intendeth a fearful Revenge, comprizing under it Indignation and Wrath, Tribulation and Anguiſh, as that which is due to Sinners upon the commiſſion of any the leaſt Tranſgreſſion: But when
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93499:37"/> to a Righteous Perſon accepted of God through Chriſt, as here in my Text, for a work approved by him, then indeed it doth not import any merit or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert on Man's part, but abundance of Mercy and Grace on God's part, who, though we are unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Servants, and can merit nothing at his hands, yet will not ſuffer us to do or endure any thing for his ſake, without a moſt tranſcendently great and glorious Recompence.</p>
               <p>WHAT that recompence of reward was, upon which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo ſtedfaſtly fixed his eye, is not here I confeſs diſtinctly ſet down, but yet we may eaſily collect from the carriage of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that it was ſome higher Honour, ſome better Pleaſure, ſome more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collent and durable Treaſure, than the Land of <hi>Aegypt</hi> could ever afford him, otherwiſe, making choice of theſe, why is it that we find him renouncing thoſe, unleſs we ſhould think him to have changed for the worſe, when yet we find the Spirit of God, in the words of my Text, commending his choice?</p>
               <p>'TWAS not then any Temporal Reward, but an Eternal Reward that <hi>Moſes</hi> had in his eye. 'Twas not Earth, but Heaven; 'twas not the Meat that periſheth, but the Meat which will indure to Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life; 'twas not any Momentary Pleaſure laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only for a Seaſon, but it was Fulneſs of Joy in God's preſence, it was perfect freedom from Sin, it was Grace glorified, it was the Beatifical Viſion of God in Heaven, together with thoſe Soul-ſatisfying Pleaſures that are at his right hand for evermore, to which, in all his obedience, we find <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looking.</p>
               <p>SO then from the practiſe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Man of God, thus fixing his eye in all his obedience upon
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93499:38"/> the recompence of Reward, and encouraging himſelf therewith chearfully to bear the Croſs of Chriſt, to Mortification, Self-denyal, and the like wholſome ſeverities of Religion, you may obſerve with me this point of</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> That God's People for their better encouragement to all holy, ſelf-denying, and obediential walking before him, they may lawfully have Reſpect to the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the Reward.</q>
               <p>WHILST we are denying our ſelves, running the way of God's Commandments, and doing the work which he hath given us to finiſh here on Earth, 'tis no Soloeciſm at all in Chriſtianity, for us to have our eye ſtedfaſtly fixed upon that eternally glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which the Lord hath laid up with himſelf for us in the Kingdom of Heaven. We may, lawfully walking with God all our life, be encouraged againſt whatever Difficulties and Perſecutions we meet with in Heaven's way, to think how incorruptible the Crown is, how glorious the Kingdom, how unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the Joy, how ſecure the Reſt, how endleſs the Pleaſures, how undefiled the Inheritance, how full, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interruptible, and everlaſtingly ſatisfying, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God over all bleſſed for ever is, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we ſhall take Poſſeſſion in the hour of death.</p>
               <p>HOLY <hi>Daniel,</hi> when praying in the Land of his Captivity, he opened his Window, and ſet his face towards <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> Thus when Praying, when Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, when Suffering, and Dying for Chriſt, we may lawfully open the Eye of Faith, and ſet our faces towards the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> towards the promiſed <hi>Canaan,</hi> towards the Temple of God in Zion, the place of our eternally bleſſed, and glorious Reſt.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:93499:38"/>
               <p>'TIS a bold attempt for Men to make reſtrictions where God himſelf hath made none; for Men to ſay we <hi>muſt not,</hi> when God himſelf ſaith we <hi>may</hi> in all our obedience have an eye to the recompenſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to the full enjoyment of him in Glory.</p>
               <p>THE example of <hi>Moſes</hi> in this place, doth evince beyond all exception, that ſome reſpect may lawfully be had to the recompence of the Reward, at leaſt by way of motive and encouragement to ſtir us up, and to quicken us both in doing and ſuffering for the God of Heaven. For this you ſee is given in as one ſpecial reaſon, Why he refuſed to be called the Son of <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Daughter: Why he <hi>choſe rather to ſuffer affliction with the People of God, than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon:</hi> And, why he <hi>esteemed the Reproach of Chriſt greater Riches than the Treaſures of Aegypt,</hi> even becauſe he <hi>had a reſpect to the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the Reward,</hi> eſteeming of all the Riches, Honours, Pleaſures and Enjoyments of this World, as not worthy to be compared with the Glory that was to be revealed in him.</p>
               <p>AND if <hi>Moſes</hi> might thus incourage himſelf to indure hardſhip, as a good Souldier of Jeſus Chriſt, by having an eye fixed upon the recompence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, upon Glory, Honour, and Immortality, why ſhould it not be lawful for Chriſtians to do the ſame? How can that be unlawful in Chriſtians, which the Holy Ghoſt hath left upon eternal record, as a matter of high commendation in him? Let us not think that the Lord will condemn us for looking at that in our Obedience, for which he hath ſo highly commended his Servant <hi>Moſes.</hi> That which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him for a Virtue, will never be imputed to us for a Crime: But we alſo, as well as he, may, for our better encouragement in all the ways of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93499:39"/> have reſpect to the recompence of reward, to that <hi>far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory.</hi> The Husbandman can cheerfully undergo the Labour and Charges of Seed-time, though many times very great, when his eye is fixed upon the Harveſt. Thus to make us chearful in ſowing to the Spirit, we may lawfully have an eye to the great Harveſt, when every one that now ſoweth Righteouſneſs, ſhall be ſure to Reap a <hi>full Crop of Eternal Glory,</hi> Gal. 6.8.9.</p>

               <p n="4">IV. AND laſtly, I ſhall help you to improve this Truth, by way of Uſe and Application, that ſo it may
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93499:39"/> not be Unprofitable, but every way Advantageous to your Souls.</p>
               <p>BEFORE I come to theſe things, you muſt give me leave to premiſe ſomething (as was hinted.) by way of introduction, which I ſhall wholly comprize in theſe two particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>THAT we are bound to ſerve the Lord, and to walk in all dutiful obedience before him, though there were no Heaven, no Glory, nor reward of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life to be expected from him.</hi> The obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our obedience to the Lord Jehovah, ariſeth not ſo much from the promiſe of Eternal Life, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Commandment, as from the authority of God's Commanding.</p>
               <p>INDEED, when-ever God ſweetens his Precepts with Promiſes, crowning our Temporal Obedience with an Eternally Glorious Recompence, this lays us under a ſtronger engagement: But yet if you ſeparate betwixt the Precept and the Promiſe, if you take away the Reward of Eternal Life, yet all this will not diſſolve, nor nullify that obligation of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God, that lies upon us. For impoſſible it is, and utterly repugnant to the quality of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Creatures, as we are, not to be ſubject to the will of our Creator, and indebted in all poſſible O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to him that made us.</p>
               <p>SUCH is the tranſcendent Excellency of God, that in himſelf he is infinitely worthy of all our Services, and ſuch is the Sovereignty of God over us, that though we ſhould ſerve him ten thouſand years together, in the moſt holy, ſeraphick, and heavenly manner that ever Saint or Angel did, yet after all
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93499:40"/> this, he might annihilate us, and yet do us no wrong.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> The Doctrine explain'd; ſhewing what it is to have a Reſpect to the Recompence of the Reward, in Six Particulars.</head>
               <p n="1">I. THESE things premiſed, I come now to ſhew you, What it is to have Reſpect in our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Recompence of Reward: And that I ſhall indeavour to do in theſe few Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>STEDFASTLY to believe, that there is a Reward for the Righteous, and that our Labour ſhall never be in Vain in the Lord.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.5.6. Faith is the Eye of the Soul, that gives it a ſight of thoſe eternal good things, which are not ſeen: So that when in our Obedience, we get as it were upon the top of Mount <hi>Piſgah,</hi> thence taking by the Eye of Faith, a Proſpect of the Heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> where after our weariſom Pilgrimage, we ſhall have an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93499:42"/> glorious Reſt, then we have <hi>reſpect to the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the Reward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>MEN may poſſibly diſcourſe of Heaven and Glory, telling you to Admiration, how incorruptible the Crown is, how everlaſting the Joy, and how tranſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently Glorious the Happineſs, which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for thoſe that Love him: But till they ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly believe the Truth of all this, till by Faith they can look within the Vail, till by Faith they can An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedate Heaven, and bring down the bright Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections of eternal Glory into their own Hearts, they have no reſpect to the Recompence of the Reward. For how can he have reſpect to Heaven and Glory, to eternal Life and Happineſs in the World to come, who Believes them not?</p>
               <p>THE Sun is a Glorious Body, but that's undiſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to a Blind Man, who wants an Eye to behold the Luſtre and Splendour of it: So though the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Reward be tranſcendently Glorious, and ten thouſand times more Radiant than the Sun in it's Noon-day brightneſs, yet an Unbeliever can have no reſpect to it, as wanting an Eye of Faith to diſcern all this. There is a dark Miſt upon Eternity to all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers; they are led by carnal Reaſon, and will therefore believe no more than what Senſe diſcovers: but now Faith, that gives a preſent Subſiſtence to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Glory, and is the convincing Evidence of <hi>things hoped for,</hi> of Heaven, and eternal Felicity, though as yet <hi>unſeen.</hi> Heb. 11.1.</p>
               <p>SENSE cannot out-ſee time, nor look beyond the Grave; but Faith gives the Soul a clearer Proſpect of Eternity, and ſhews it under all Afflictions, <hi>a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory.</hi> 2 Cor. 4.17. So then, when by Faith we can look into another
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93499:42"/> World, believing that verily there is a Reward for the Righteous; when by Faith we can aſſure our hearts of the Glory to come, believing that he who Sows to the Spirit, ſhall of the Spirit Reap Life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, then we <hi>have Reſpect to the Recompence of the Reward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>FID<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CIALLY to apply it to our ſelves, as that which we believe ſhall be the Recompence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Lord will eternally Crown us.</hi> Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> whilſt he refuſed to be called the Son of <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s Daughter, eſteeming the Reproach of Chriſt greater Riches than the Treaſures in <hi>Egypt;</hi> doubtleſs he looked upon the Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> as his Portion, upon the Kingdom of Heaven as his own Inheritance, upon Life, Happineſs, and Eternal Glory, as things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for himſelf, and ſo he had Reſpect unto the Recompence of the Reward. To come unto the Lord in ways of Obedience, believing him to be a plentiful Rewarder of all that diligently ſeek him, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: but when we appropriate God for a Portion to our ſelves, ſaying with <hi>Thomas, My Lord, and my God,</hi> and believe him to have prepared for us in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, ſuch Eternally Glorious Things, as eye never ſaw, nor ear heard, nor could the Heart of Man ever yet conceive of, then we have Reſpect indeed to the Recompence of the Reward.</p>
               <p>THE Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I confeſs, hath Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized all thoſe who urge it upon Believers, as their duty to appropriate God, and Chriſt, and eternal Glory in Heaven, to their own Souls; and they call us by way of Reproach <hi>Specialiſts,</hi> for maintaining that the Object of ſaving Faith is the ſpecial Mercy of God; Remiſſion of Sins for me, and Juſtification through the Blood of Chriſt for me, and a Crown of Life laid up for me, and a Kingdom of Eternal Glory
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93499:43"/> to be expected by me in Particular; this they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim againſt as the firſt-born of all Abſurdities: But believe it Chriſtians, without this particular Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation of God and Chriſt, and Eternal Glory to our ſelves, our Faith will bring us no more Peace, no more Comfort, no more Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, than for <hi>Lazarus</hi> to hear there was Food enough in <hi>Dives</hi>'s Houſe, when he might not ſo much as taſte of the Crumbs that fell from that Rich Man's Table! <hi>Hagar</hi> had a Well of Water hard by her, but for all that ſhe ſits weeping, ſo long as ſhe ſaw it not: Thus Chriſtian, though God and Chriſt and the Kingdom of Heaven, with all the Glory thereof lye before thee, yet ſo long as thou lookeſt not upon God as thy Portion, upon Chriſt as thy Saviour, and upon the Kingdom of Heaven as thy Eternal Inheritance, no wonder though thou weep, and go mourning from day to day! For 'tis only reſpect to God and Chriſt, to Heaven and Eternal Glory, as things wherein we our ſelves have an Intereſt, that can effectually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort our Souls, and make us rejoyce with Joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable, and full of Glory.</p>
               <p>STRIVE we then to look upon Heaven and Eternal Glory, as prepared for us in Particular, to look upon a Crown of Righteouſneſs as laid up for us, and then we have reſpect indeed to the Recompence of the Reward! Though, Chriſtian, thou canſt not ſay Riches are thine, yet ſee that thou canſt ſay Grace and Glory are thine, and that is much better. When once the Soul can ſay, though now I Sow in Tears, yet anon I ſhall Reap in Joy; though now I walk in Sackcloth, yet I ſhall ſhortly be cloathed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the White Robes of eternal Glory; though be now Poor in this World, yet for all that, I am Rich in Faith, and Heir-apparent to the moſt glorious Kingdom that ever eye beheld; though I now lie
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93499:43"/> amongſt the Pots, mourning like the <hi>Doves</hi> of the Valley, yet, looking towards Heaven, can ſay, above yonder Heavens muſt I dwell for ever; above yonder Heavens hath the Lord prepared for me a Crown of Righteouſneſs, a Manſion of eternal Glory, all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Joy in his Preſence, and unperiſhing Pleaſures at his own Right Hand for evermore. When thus, I ſay, the Soul can Appropriate the Happineſs, the Glory, and the Royalties of the World to come, to it ſelf, then it hath a due reſpect to the Recompence of the Reward.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>SERIO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SLY to conſider of Heaven, and Glory, and often to be meditating upon them.</hi> 'Tis not a ſudden motion, nor now and then a tranſient thought about eternal Life and Happineſs in another World, that will prove a Man to have due reſpect to the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the Reward: But there muſt be ſerious Thoughts, and fixed Meditations upon them, ſo that the Mind may be delightfully buſied about, and wholly taken up in the ſweet Contemplation of them. <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi> being a Man of low Stature, could not ſee Chriſt, but by climbing up into the <hi>Sycamore-Tree.</hi>

                  </note> Thus Chriſtians, unleſs you climb up into the high <hi>Sycamore</hi> of Heavenly Meditation, ſeriouſly fixing your Thoughts in all your Obedience upon that Crown, that Kingdom, that eternal weight of Glory, which God hath prepared for thoſe that love him, you can never have any due reſpect to the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the Reward.</p>
               <p>WHEN God would have <hi>Abraham</hi> take a view of <hi>Canaan,</hi> he called him up into the Mountain of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93499:44"/> 
                  <hi>Nebo,</hi> to the top of <hi>Piſgah:</hi> So, would we ever take a Proſpect of the Holy Land, the Promiſed <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as that which muſt be the Reward of all our Labours, the way is to go up unto the Mountain of <hi>Nebo,</hi> even to the higheſt <hi>Piſgah</hi> of Heavenly Meditations. Such is the Power of Holy Meditation, that it ſets a Man upon the Shoar of Eternity, it carries him with <hi>Paul</hi> up into the Third Heaven, and brings him, notwithſtanding any flaming Sword of Worldly oppoſition to keep him out, into the Paradiſe of God; ſo that now he can ſee the Beauties, taſte the Pleaſures, and clearly take a view of the Glories of the World to come. Whilſt <hi>Stephen</hi> was ſtedfaſtly looking towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he ſaw the Glory of God, and Chriſt, ſtanding at his Right Hand: Thus Chriſtians, we never get ſo full a Proſpect of God, and Chriſt, and Eternal Glory, as when we ſeriouſly meditate Heaven, ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly fixing our thoughts on the World to come. We Read of <hi>Elijah,</hi> that he was carried up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a fiery Chariot: Thus Holy Meditation, it would carry us above the Clouds, it would give us Poſſeſſion of Heaven before we come there, and ſet us in the midſt of all the Glory and Royalties of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life, as if they were already preſent. Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoughts are as ſo many ſteps towards our Eternal Reſt: When by theſe therefore we Travel every day to the City of God, and delightfully walk therein; when every day we take, as it were, a turn or two in Paradiſe, ſeriouſly Meditating Heaven, together with the glory that ſhall ſhortly be revealed in us; then we have Reſpect indeed to the Recompence of the Reward.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>EARNESTLY to deſire and long for it.</hi> When we ſee ſo much of the Excellency, Worth, and Glory of the World to come, that we groan within
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93499:44"/> ourſelves, deſiring, with all our hearts to get out of theſe Houſes of Clay, and to be cloathed upon with our Houſe which is from Heaven, then we have reſpect to the Recompence of the Reward, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. When <hi>Paul</hi> had once been wrapt up into the Third Heaven, and ſeen the Paradiſe of God, his Note was ever after, <hi>I deſire to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt:</hi> Thus the Soul that hath a reſpect to the Recompence of the Reward, he hath been in the Heavenly Paradiſe, he hath taſted ſome Cluſters of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and therefore he cannot but long for more; he can never be ſoon enough with Chriſt, he can never ſoon enough get above the World, and Sin, and Temptations; he can never be ſoon enough with God in Glory; Oh! when ſhall it be? They that have the firſt Fruits of the Spirit, cannot chuſe but have their eyes always fixed upon the Recompence of the Reward, earneſtly deſiring the time of Harveſt, when they ſhall Reap a full Crop of Eternal Happineſs, and Glory in the Heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AS <hi>Noah's Dove</hi> was reſtleſs, finding no place whereupon to ſet the ſole of her foot, till ſhe came into the Ark; ſo, Chriſtians, if your eyes are rightly fixed upon the Recompence of the Reward, you will find your ſelves carried out after Heaven and Glory in a reſtleſs manner, and will never ſit down ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, till you come to reſt in the Boſome of God's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Love. Never, Chriſtians, did <hi>Rachel</hi> more long for Children, nor <hi>David</hi> for the Waters of <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem,</hi> nor <hi>Abſalom</hi> to ſee the King's Face, than your Souls will long for the glorious Liberty of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, to be drinking the Waters of Life in the Heavenly Paradiſe, and to come to the Beatifical Viſion of God in Glory, where you ſhall ſee him Face to Face, in caſe you have an eye rightly fixed upon the Recompence of the Reward!</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:93499:45"/>
               <p>THE Language of every Soul, whoſe eye is rightly fixed upon Heaven and Glory, it is like unto that of <hi>Job,</hi> ſpeaking forth his deſires after God, <hi>Oh that I knew where to find him, that I might come even to his ſeat! Job</hi> 23.3. Such a Soul is impregnated with holy deſires and longings after God in Glory, and with theſe the Soul travels all the day long, crying out with the Church in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> as in pain to be delivered from under the bondage of Sin and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, into Heavenly Glory.</p>
               <p>GIVE the Soul Riches, give it Honours, give it all the Pleaſures that can be thought of to raviſh the heart of a Carnal Man, yet having an eye rightly fixed upon the Recompence of Reward, in vain ſhall you ſeek, by theſe, to bribe it out of its holy deſires, and longings after God in Glory. For ſcorning and trampling upon them all, as unworthy to come in competition with God, it even breaketh through deſire after him, and can truly ſay of God, with holy <hi>David, Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſides thee!</hi> Pſal. 73.25.</p>
               <p>'TIS juſt with the Soul as with ſome Women in the time of their Impregnature, who if they ſee any thing, when they are with Child, that they have a mind to, they muſt have it, or elſe they will long and dye for it: Thus the Soul, that by Faith hath got a ſight of Heavenly Enjoyments; now the heart of ſuch a Soul it is ſet upon Heaven, and he muſt have Heaven, upon a Crown of Life, and he muſt have a Crown of Life, upon God and Chriſt, and Eternal Glory, and he muſt have them all together, or elſe (give him what you can) he will long and die un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied!</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:93499:45"/>
               <p>THERE is ſo much of the Beauty, Lovelineſs, and Glory of Chriſt revealed to the Soul, in looking upon the Recompence of Reward, that now it grows impatient of living any longer without him, crying out, as ſhe did in another caſe; <hi>Why are his Chariots ſo long in coming?</hi> and, <hi>Why tarry the wheels of his Chariots? When will my beloved make haſte, and be like a young Roe upon the Mountains of Spices?</hi> When will the day break and the ſhadows fly away, that I may ſee my beloved in his Glory? When will he come to put an end to theſe days of Sin and Sorrow, that I may reſt for ever in the Boſome of his Eternal Love? When will he take me by the hand, and lead me out of the Wilderneſs of this World, into the Heavenly <hi>Canaan?</hi> When will he rebuke the Winds and the Seas, that will give me no reſt in this Trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome World, and ſet me ſafe on the Shoar of Eternal Happineſs? When will he deliver me from this Body of Death, and gather my Soul to the Spirits of Juſt Men made perfect? When will he take from me theſe Rags of Mortality, and cauſe me to be cloathed upon with an Houſe not made with hands, Eternal in the Heavens? When will he make me return and come to Sion with Songs, and everlaſting Joy upon my head? When will he cauſe me to obtain fulneſs of Joy and Gladneſs with him, in Eternal Manſions of Glory, that Sorrow, and Sin, and Sighing, being done away, I may be with the Lord for ever? Oh, when ſhall I once ſee that bleſſed day!</p>
               <p>NOW, What is it, I beſeech you, after which your hearts do thus ſtrongly breathe, thus inſatiably thirſt, thus impatiently long? If Riches will not ſatisfy, but you muſt have a Treaſure in Heaven; if Worldly Honour will not ſatisfy, but you muſt have a Crown of Righteouſneſs from Chriſt himſelf; if Carnal Pleaſures will not ſatisfy, but you muſt have
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93499:46"/> that fulneſs of Joy which is in God's Preſence, and thoſe Pleaſures which are at his Right Hand for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more; if, in a word, the Life that now is, will not ſatisfy, but you muſt, though you dye for it, go live for ever with Chriſt in Glory; why then, there is no doubt, Chriſtians, but with <hi>Moſes,</hi> you have an eye to the Recompence of Reward. For then our eye is rightly fixed upon the Recompence of Reward, when our Souls are carried out in ſtrong deſires after God, and Chriſt, and Eternal Glory, as our only Happineſs!</p>

               <p>GOD is not ſo auſtere a Task-maſter, as to envy his People their Comforts in a way of Duty; nor will he ever impute it to them, as their ruin, that in keeping his Commandments, they had an eye, for their own incouragement, to the Recompence of the Reward. And truly, if to be incouraged in a way of Obedience, by the Recompence of Reward, may be conſtrued a juſt forfeiture of a Mans ingenuity, as ſome would bear us in hand, I ſee not (for my part) how we ſhall be able to excuſe any of God's deareſt Children, no nor our Bleſſed Lord himſelf, but muſt confeſs them to have been acted by a ſlaviſh and ſervile Spirit, (which yet to do, were the firſt-born of all horrid Blaſphemies.) For, though it ſhould have been written in Capital Letters, with a Pen pluckt from the wing of a glorious Seraphim, yet it could not have been more plain and legible, than the Holy Ghoſt hath already expreſſed it, that the moſt holy of all God's Children, our Bleſſed Redeemer himſelf not accepted, had an eye for their incouragement, in all the ways of Obedience, to the Recompence of the Reward.</p>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93499:51"/> but not primarily before, nor ſupreamely and above, the Glory of God.</p>
               <p>GOD hath, indeed, ſo inſeperably conjoyned his own Glory and Man's Salvation together, that they cannot poſſibly be divided, nor put aſunder: but yet, as 'tis ſaid of them in the Reſurrection, God will have every thing in it's own order; we may intend the Salvation of our own Souls, making that an inferiour and ſubordinate end in our Obedience, however, that which we ought to make the ſupream, and the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate end of all, is the glory of God: For the glory of God (you muſt know) it's the greateſt good; 'tis the Perfection and united ſplendour of all the glorious Rayes of his other Attributes, infinitely ſurpaſſing the glory of all Created Excellencies, and therefore more to be preferred than the Salvation of the whole World; better all the World ſhould be Damned, and go to Hell for ever, than that God over all bleſſed for ever, ſhould not be Glorified. And truly, when we go about to ſubordinate the glory of God to our own Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, making eternal Life and Happineſs, our ultimate end, and God's Glory ſubſervient to that, we commit an act of the grandeſt Sacriledge, as doing what in us lyes, to take the Crown from God, and ſet it upon our own heads.</p>
               <p>GOD is willing to give us Heaven, to give us Life and Immortality, with any thing that may conduce to our eternal Happineſs, but his own Glory; and that he profeſſeth he will not give to any other: The Benefit, the Comfort, the eternal Recompence of all our Obedience ſhall be our own, but the Glory and Praiſe, that doth wholly belong to God, and muſt more be regarded than our own Salvation.

God's glory muſt be the <hi>Terminus Reductivus,</hi> to which all our Obedience muſt be reduced, as the ultimate end of it. Every Chriſtian is a Spiritual Archer, and God's glory muſt be the mark that he ſhoots at. He is a Spiritual Traveller, and though he may take up his lodging at his own Salvation, yet God's glory muſt be the end of his Journey. He is, in a word, a Spiritual Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and though he may caſt forth the Anchor of hope at his own eternal Happineſs, yet he is like to make Shipwreck of himſelf, if he go about to put in any where elſe for harbour, but at the fair haven of God's glory. As all the Rivers run into the Sea, and all the Lines meet in the Center; ſo all our actions, and all the Rivers of our own Happineſs, they muſt meet together Concentring themſelves in God's glory. And certainly, Chriſtians, we never attain the end of our Faith, the Salvation of our Souls better, than when Faith and Salvation both are referred to the glory of God as their ultimate end. We never come ſooner to that <hi>Reſt,</hi> which remains for the People of God, than, when God's glory is made the Center, not only of the works which we do, but alſo of the <hi>Reſt</hi> it ſelf which we look for, as the eternal Reward of them. We are never (in a word) more ſure to hit the mark of our own Salvation, than when we aim moſt directly at God's glory. For then your reſpect to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of Reward is ſuch as God would have it to be, when you principally ſeek for Heaven, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Glory, that God himſelf may thereby be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

If we may not prefer our own Happineſs before God's glory, much leſs may we wholly leave off the care of God's glory, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it out of our thoughts, in ſeeking to make our ſelves happy. Since God, in ſeeing his own Glory, did alſo conſult the Happineſs, and eternal Salvation of our Souls, why, 'twere a point of the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude in the World, for us, in ſeeking our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not alſo to conſult his Honour, endeavouring, that whilſt we are ſaved, his Name may be glorified! 'Tis unlawful to Dogmatize that we muſt be willing to be damned, that God may be glorified, or elſe we are ſtill but Hypocrites, and were never ſufficiently humbled: but to be willing to have God himſelf diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured, and loſe his glory, that we may be ſaved, is moſt wicked and abominable.

He that doth not take aim before he ſhoots can never hit the mark: So, Chriſtians, if you only look at your ſelves, not taking, in all your Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, a right aim at God's glory, you can never hit the mark of your own Salvation.

               <p>THE Moon, when in the full, looking directly upon the Sun, is a glorious Creature, but if once the Earth interpoſe it ſelf betwixt her and the Sun, ſhe becomes a dark, obſcure Body, of whom we may ſay, That there is no form, nor beauty, nor comelineſs in her that we ſhould deſire her: Thus, Chriſtians, whilſt in our Obedience, we look directly upon God's glory, endeavouring to promote that, as well as our own Salvation, we are glorious in the Eyes of God; but if once we ſuffer ſelf-ends to intercept, and wholly to ſhut out our reſpect to God's glory, we preſently loſe our beauty in God's eyes, and his Soul can no longer take pleaſure in us.<note n="(s)" place="bottom">Etſi non injuſtè agimus intuendo mercedem a deo nobis oblatam, dum in bonis operibus laboramus: id tamen attentiùs videndum eſt, ne ſolum cauſà oblati praemij commoveamur. <hi>Pet.

For, when we reſpect our ſelves, in what we do either alone, or above God, God hath no reſpect at all to us; nor will he ever Crown our Souls with eternal Happineſs, in caſe we ſeek it alone, and not in the neareſt conjunction with his glory.</p>

That whereby, Chriſtians, you differ from others, from the vileſt of Sinners, from the Damned themſelves, that are now roaring out in Hell, is not of Merit, but of Grace; not of Debt, but a free Donative; 'tis nothing in your ſelves, but the free diſtinguiſhing love of God, dropping the Pearl of Grace into your hearts, whilſt others are left to periſh in their Sins, that hath made the difference. And ſurely by thoſe graces which you freely receive from God, you may not think to Merit Life and Eternity of Glory at the hands of God.

               <p n="4">4. <hi>WE are to have reſpect in our Obedience to the Recompence of Reward, not carnally looking for a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Happineſs, but Spiritually, as longing for an Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs that ſhall conſist in the adequate Perfection of all our Graces, together with the full enjoyment of God in Glory.</hi> We are not to look for a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Paradiſe to gratify the Fleſh; but for a Sinleſs ſtate of Holineſs, where Grace ſhall be perfected into Glory. We may not think of bathing our Souls in Worldly Delights and Carnal Pleaſures; but of coming to the full injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God himſelf, whom to ſee without end, love without loathing, and praiſe, without ever being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is the only complement of all our Happineſs.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93499:59"/> There are multitudes of Men and Women in the world, who having imbibed ſome groſs Conceits, and carnal Notions of Heaven, would be glad, when they can live no longer here, to take up there, as conceiting it to be a place accomodate to the deſires of their own carnal Hearts: But, we never have any due reſpect to the recompence of the Reward, till we look upon Heaven as a place, where Sin ſhall be wholly aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, Grace perfectly glorified, the World trampled upon, and God over all bleſſed for ever, enjoy'd as the Center of perfect Reſt, and everlaſting Satisfaction. As <hi>Balaam</hi> deſired to dye the death of the righteous, which he knew would be Crowned with Peace, but had no care at all to conform himſelf to the life of the righteous: ſo, many there be who deſire Heaven as a place of Happineſs, but not as a place of perfect Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. Such is the Malignity of a carnal Heart, that it will aſſimulate whatever it meets with, and turn it into the likeneſs of it's own brutiſh Luſts. So that whenever a carnal heart deſires Heaven, it's not an Heaven of God's preparing, but an Heaven of it's own fancying; not an Heaven to make it perfectly Holy, but an Heaven that will make it ſenſually Happy. As a little Leaven turns the whole Lump into it's own Sourneſs; or, as the Salt Sea turns the Freſh Rivers, and the Sweet Showers of Heaven into Salt Waters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So, the Heart which is Unſanctified, it turns <hi>Bethel</hi> into <hi>Bethaven;</hi> the holy City of <hi>Sion,</hi> into a filthy <hi>Sodom;</hi> and the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it ſelf into <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon;</hi> looking only for the Wages of Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and for Heaven as a place of Senſual Pleaſure, but not as a place of Spiritual Injoyments. As ſome <hi>Jews (Acts</hi> 1.6.) had carnal Notions of Chriſt, and his Kingdom, looking for a carnal <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who ſhould come in Worldly Pomp and Splendour to reſtore the Kingdom to <hi>Iſrael:</hi> So, many that profeſs themſelves to be Chriſtians, they have carnal Notions about the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93499:60"/> Recompence of the Reward, looking after a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Paradice, after an Heaven that is wholly Carnal, like their own hearts, abounding with nothing but Fleſhly Delights, and Senſual Contentments. They conceive indeed of Heaven as a place where there is Freedom from all Miſery, and as a place wherein all Fulneſs of Joy, of Delights, and everlaſting Pleaſures dwells: But yet both theſe, the Miſery removed, and the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures indulged, both Freedom from the one, and the Injoyment of the other, they fancy in a way ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their own Carnal Minds, and ſo they can deſire to come to Heaven: Oh but Remember, Chriſtians, it's not an Heaven of our own Fancying, but of God's Preparing, that in all our Obedience we are to look after. 'Tis not <hi>Egypt,</hi> but <hi>Canaan;</hi> 'tis not an Idol's Temple, but the Temple of the living God; 'tis not a wicked <hi>Sidon,</hi> but the holy hill of Sion, the place of God's royal Reſidence, where we are to expect the Reward of all our Labours. Though then you may have Reſpect, in your Obedience, to the Recompence of the Reward; yet take heed that you turn it not into the Wages of Unrighteouſneſs. And, though you may look at Heaven as the Reward of all your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, yet beſure that you do not turn it into a <hi>Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Paradice. 'Tis not ſo much Senſual Pleaſures, as a perfect Freedom from all inordinate Deſires after them, that ſhall be our Reward: Nor ſo much deliverance from Helliſh Torments, as the full injoyment of God himſelf, in a State of Holineſs, that ſhall be our Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. There is no other Glory in Heaven, than what ſprings out of the Seed of Grace, grown up into a Flower: Nor is there any other Heaven that can make us compleatly happy, but full and everlaſting Communion with the God of Heaven. 'Tis true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the Recompence of the Reward doth admit of many glorious Ingredients, which do all of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to make up the Soul reviving Cordial of compleat
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93499:60"/> Happineſs: But yet, that which is the Elixir of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Glory, the Quint-eſſence of all our Happineſs, and the very Boſome of the Coeleſtial Paradice, why, 'tis an heart made perfect in Holineſs, and ſo fully enjoying Communion with God himſelf. For, as the Moon and Stars, though glorious Creatures, cannot make day in the World, but muſt leave that to the Sun, from whom they borrow their Light: So, thô there be many rich Jewels, ſhining like ſo many glorious Stars in the Firmament of heaven, yet all of them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſatisfy the Soul, nor make a day of perfect happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to dawn upon it, but muſt leave it for that to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in Grace, and to the full enjoyment of God ov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er all bleſſed for ever. So then, the Recompence of Reward, whereunto we may have a reſpect in all our Obedience, it's nothing but Grace grown up into Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, together with an Heaven of Reſt in the Boſome of God's eternal Love. Whilſt therefore we have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Recompence of the Reward, let us be ſure that we look upon it, not Carnally, but Spiritually, not with an Eye of Senſe, but with an Eye of Faith; not through the Falſe <hi>Glaſs</hi> of our own carnal Hearts, but through the Pure <hi>Glaſs</hi> of God's holy Word; and as therein for our Incouragement, we find it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to us, and curiouſly drawn out by the Finger of God himſelf, in it's moſt pure, angelical, and heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enly Complexion. Do not look with that grand Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualiſt <hi>Epicurus,</hi> for ſuch an Happineſs when you come to Heaven, as is wholly immerſed in carnal Delights, in the Flatteries of Luſt, in the Blandiſhments of Senſe, and the like Brutiſh Pleaſures: But remember the Happineſs which abides you in God's heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, 'tis a bright Conſtellation of Graces, Crowned with the Quint-eſſence of perfect Holineſs, and all of them ripened into ſo many Flowers of Glory; 'tis the Facial Preſence of a propitious Deity, accepting of, and bleſſing the Soul with, eternal Rejoycing; 'tis the

God hath, not only the tender Indulgence of a Father, but he hath alſo, the dreadful Countenance of a Judge: And as that doth keep us from deſpairing, ſo this ſhould keep us from Preſuming; as the thoughts of God's Fatherly Indulgence, ſhould work in us an intire Love and Affection to him, ſo the thoughts of his juſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt all Unrighteouſneſs, muſt breed in us all Reverence and due Devotion, to <hi>work out our own Salvation with fear and trembling, Phil.</hi> 2.12.

Slaviſh Fear is diſingenuous, making him, that is acted by it, more afraid of Wrath, and Hell, and Eternal Burnings, than he is of diſpleaſing the God of Heaven; and therefore not becoming a Child of God: But now, Filial Fear, it is wonderful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous, filling the Soul, whenever it draws nigh to God, with all Reverent and Awful Thoughts of him, and cauſing it to be more afraid of diſpleaſing God, and coming under his Frowns, than of Hell it

When we are acted more in ways of Obedience by the Fear of Hell, and by the deſire of Heaven, than by Love to God, this argues a ſervile mercenary frame of Spirit, clearly evincing, that our reſpect to the Recompence of the Reward is not ſuch as it ought to be. For, though we may lawfully have reſpect to them both, looking upon the Torments of the one, to deter us from Sinning

Oh therefore ſee to it, that in all your Obedience to God, you be acted, not by the Spirit of Bondage, but by the Spirit of Adoption; not by Fear, but by Love; not by ſervile and mercenary, but by filial, and ingenuous Principles! You may ſet the Joys of Heaven on the Right Hand, and the Torments of Hell on the Left, having an eye to them both, as ſtrong incentives to quicken you in your motion: But the Love of God in Chriſt, this muſt be the ſpring and main ground of your moving in Heaven's way.<note n="(p)" place="bottom">Deum non colimus niſi propter deum, ut deus quem colimus, ipſe ſit merces.

Fooliſh Sinners are apt to pleaſe themſelves, with ſome pleaſant dreams, about going to Heaven when they dye, not conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, how vexatious, and contrary that holy habitation would be to them, ſhould they come thither with their Natures unſanctified. For the accompliſhment of true delight, there muſt be an harmonious conformity and correſpondency, betwixt the faculty and the object, about which it is converſant: So that, if the faculty be not duely prepared, let the object be never ſo pleaſant, yet it will afford nothing of true delight, but a deal of vexation and wearineſs. The Sun is a pleaſant object, affording much delight and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to one that hath no impediment in his ſight, and yet to ſore Eyes, there is nothing more afflicting and tedious, than to behold it: Thus, though Heaven be a place of unſpeakable Pleaſure, adorned with all glorious Objects that a gracious heart can deſire, yet ſhould a Man unſanctified come there, he would think himſelf in the very Suburbs of Hell, and inſtead of meeting with happineſs therein, he would find it a place of his greateſt diſquietment. If our firſt Parents were, by one Sin, ſo far indiſpoſed for Communion with God, that they were not able to bear his Preſence, nor ſo much as able to look upon the back parts of God, in the Earthly Paradice, but ſought, through the dread of his Preſence ſeizing upon them, to hide themſelves from the Eyes of Omniſciency; How then will unſanctified Sinners, whoſe Souls are become a very <hi>Sodom</hi> of all Unrighteouſneſs, be able to bear the holy Preſence of God, to ſee him face to

Believe it, Sinners, unleſs your ſore-eyes be healed, and your Natures Sanctified, you may find as much comfort in Hell, as you could in beholding the Face of God in Heaven. That Heaven, which is a Paradice of all delights to a gracious Soul, you that are not Sanctified and made New Creatures, you would find it a very Tophet, a place of all helliſh and intollerable Torments, ſhould you enter into it. In <hi>Ireland,</hi> they ſay, is a Fountain, whoſe Waters kill all thoſe Beaſts that drink of them, but is pleaſant to the People, not hurting them, though they uſually drink of it: Thus, though that pure River of Water in the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> proceeding out of the Throne of God, and of the Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.1. be more pleaſant than life it ſelf to all God's People, yet, ſhould any brutiſh Sinner, be ſuffered to drink of thoſe Waters, he would find them more bitter than the ſtroke of death. For the Soul muſt firſt be made a prepared ſubject for Heaven and the Joys thereof, or Heaven it ſelf would be an Hell to it, and the Joys of Heaven, they would fill it with the greateſt, and moſt exquiſite Torments. And truly, would Ungodly Sinners but ſet Reaſon a-work, they might eaſily ſatisfy themſelves of their own unfitneſs for Heaven, and what an hell it would be to them ſhould they come there. They that count it a wearineſs to ſerve the Lord a few hours together on Earth, how can they think themſelves fit for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where they muſt ſerve him day and night with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing to all Eternity. If they find it ſo tedious to be reſtrained from Vanity, by the preſence of a faithful Miniſter, or a ſerious Chriſtian, for a little ſcantling of time, How can they think themſelves able to bear the preſence, of an infinitely holy God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining them from all their Sins, and pleaſurable
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93499:70"/> Vanities for ever? When they cannot endure to ſpend a ſhort Sabbath, with ſeriouſneſs, in the worſhip of God, but are preſently tired out, longing that the Sabbath were over, What fitneſs have they to ſpend an Everlaſting Sabbath, in worſhiping the God of Heaven, which will never be over? Grace, dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in God's People, is now their burden, their ſore eyes cannot look upon the brightneſs of it; Oh then, How unable will they be to bear it, when all it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections being done away, it ſhall break forth into a bright Sun-ſhine of eternal dazling glory? Oh be convinced, that you muſt firſt be made holy, or you can never be made happy; you muſt firſt be ſanctified, or you can never be ſaved; you muſt firſt be cleanſed from all unrighteouſneſs, and made New Creatures, or you will never be fit to inhabit the New <hi>Jeruſalem. Esther</hi> might not come into the Kings Preſence, till firſt ſhe was waſhed and purified: So, till firſt we be throughly waſhed in the Laver of Regeneration, and purified thereby, from all Filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit, we can never enjoy God's Preſence in a ſtate of Glory.

For, ſince the Will of God is the only adequate rule and meaſure of all Holineſs, How can we but acknowledge that to be lawful and holy, which doth harmoniouſly accord with it, and in every way proportionate thereto, ſo far as we find it to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed into Holy Writ?

                  </note> Anological reſemblance of, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with God, who is alone the ſure Standard, the grand Exemplar, and the objective cauſe of all Purity and Holineſs in the Creature. Every action of Man is holy or unholy, according to it's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with, or contrariety to the Will of God. Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is nothing elſe but a pure derivation from God himſelf, the Spring and Fountain of all Purity: And therefore, whatever is conveyed into the Heart and Lives of Men, from this pure Fountain, through the Golden Pipes of God's Commandments, it muſt needs be <hi>holy, and juſt, and good.</hi> For, to be ſure, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with the rule of Holineſs, can never make a Man unholy: no more than walking in the light can produce darkneſs. Did our Holineſs conſiſt in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with ſome elſe beſides God's holy Will, in a conformity with the Decrees of Counſels, with the uncertain Records of Antiquity, with the Judgment of Fathers, with Eccleſiaſtick Conſtitutions, with Enthuſiaſtick Impulſes, or with the dictates of an Erronious Conſcience, embracing many times the ſhadow of Holineſs, and engaging Men to the ſtrict obſervation of that, for the doing whereof, God never gave his <hi>Fiat,</hi> we might then indeed come under cenſure, and be impeached of unholineſs, for conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves to the Will of God, endeavouring to tranſcribe his Commandments into our Lives and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations. But to ſet up all theſe, or any of theſe for a Rule, making them the ſtandard of Holineſs, were to uſurp God's Sovereign Authority, and to ſet the Crown of his Glory upon the head of a poor

Doubtleſs, as God is the ſole Author of our Being, ſo he muſt be the only Rule of all our Operations. We can no more be independent in theſe, than we are in that. For ſince we live in God, and have our Being from him, there is nothing in all the World, that can denominate us truly Holy, but a care to act and move according to his Righteous Will. Every Impreſſion ſuppoſes a Seal from whence it came; every Stream will lead you to the Spring-head, out of which it iſſued, and came bubbling forth; every Beam of Light doth put you in mind of the Sun, out of which it ſhines, and upon which it doth neceſſarily depend: So whatever you ſee that is Good, that is Pure, and ſhining forth, with a native Luſtre and commanding Beauty, in the Lives of Men, it may well bring to your Remembrance the God of Heaven, who is the Fountain of all Goodneſs, the Chryſtalline Spring, out of which all Moral Purity, by a Bleſſed Emanation, iſſues, and the glorious Sun of Righteouſneſs, by whom our Lives are irradiated, with moſt clarified Beams of Holineſs, and without whoſe uninterrupted Irradiations, like refracted Beams, they would preſently ceaſe to ſhine, and become a dark Chaos of all confuſions. For, as Light in the Air is nothing but a derivation from the Sun, that Fountain of Light: So, Holineſs, in us, is nothing but a Pure Emanation of Goodneſs, and a noble progeny of Moral Rectitudes, ſpringing from, and <hi>born, not of Blood, nor of the will of the Fleſh, nor of the will of Man, but of the will of God himſelf,</hi> John 1.13. whoſe Image and Superſcription they bear.

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93499:77"/> they were Theatriz'd, and brought forth upon the Stage, not only as Spectacles of Scorn and Reproach, but alſo as Objects of Perſecution, for wicked men to exerciſe their Malice and Cruelty upon, from whom they received, not only bitter Words, but alſo hard Blows: Yet they joyfully underwent it all, enduring <hi>the Croſs, and deſpiſing the Shame,</hi> as Chriſt their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer had done before them; and all this, becauſe <hi>they had an Eye to the Recompence of Reward,</hi> believing themſeves to <hi>have in Heaven, an induring Subſtance, a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory,</hi> that would abundantly make amends for all their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. So that the grand Reaſon, inducing theſe Primitive Chriſtians to indure Afflictions, and take joyfully the ſpoyling of their Goods on Earth, was their Hope of a better, and more induring Subſtance, when they came to Heaven. Beſides theſe, many pregnant Inſtances might be given out of Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, of Chriſtians incouraging themſelves by the Recompence of Reward, to run the hazard of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, Perſecution, and ſoreſt Afflictions in the World, for the ſake of Chriſt and his Cauſe. <hi>I ſhall not loſe my Life,</hi> (ſaith one Martyr, being led out to ſuffer) <hi>but change it for a better; inſtead of Coals I ſhall have Pearls!</hi> And with this Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he died comfortably. Another, Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> by name, being asked by the Sheriff, as he drew nigh to the place of Execution, <hi>How do you, Sir? Never better,</hi> (reply'd that holy Man) <hi>for now I know I am almoſt at home:</hi> Meaning Heaven, where he ſhould be with the Lord for ever. With this alſo, <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> incouraged the Chriſtians to perſeverance in the Faith, under the <hi>Arrian</hi> Perſecution, <hi>That Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was but</hi> Nubeculo citò tranſitura, <hi>a Storm, or rather a little Cloud, that being quickly blown over, would end in a glorious Sun-ſhine.</hi> Like unto him was the Practice of holy Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> who taking up a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93499:77"/> Fagot at the Stake and kiſſing it, turned his Head to the Young Man that ſuffered with him, and ſaid, <hi>Be of good Comfort Brother, for we ſhall have a merry Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with the Lord this Night. Juſtin Martyr,</hi> alſo tells us of the Chriſtians in his Day, That they, who before their Converſion had pleaſure in Uncleanneſs, did now wholly imbrace Chaſtity, they that had ſometimes uſed Magical Arts, did now dedicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the good and eternal God; they that e'er-while ſet an higher Eſtimate upon their Money, and earthly Poſſeſſions, than upon any thing elſe, did now bring all into the common Treaſury, that diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might be made according to every one's Neceſſity; they who formerly hated each other, and betwixt whom there were Heart-burnings, and deadly Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, did now Lovingly live together, and familiarly converſe with one another, praying for their very Enemies, and beſeeching thoſe that were their moſt cruel Perſecutors, to break off their Sins by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and live holy. And he gives in this as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of all, that they, together with ſuch as had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times deſpitefully uſed them, living holy, might have good Hope, and everlaſting Conſolation thrô Chriſt, receiving from God at length the reward of eternal <note n="†" place="bottom">

               <p>BUT, waving theſe, and the like Examples, as being not altogether ſo Cogent and Authentical, we ſhall conclude the Argument with holy <hi>Moſes,</hi> from whoſe Practice, the Doctrine it ſelf was deduced. <hi>Moſes,</hi> though (as we ſaid of <hi>Paul</hi>) a man ſo ambitiouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of, and paſſionately zealous for God's Glory, that rather than the leaſt Diſhonour ſhould reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, he could wiſh himſelf blotted out of God's Book of Life, in reſpect of whoſe Glory, he ſeems careleſs of his own Salvation: Yet thought it no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of his Ingenuity, to ſteal a look from Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to peep within the Vail, to caſt an eye upon the Recompence of Reward, for his incouragement to all upright, ſelf-denying, and holy walking before the God of Heaven.<note n="*" place="bottom">Fidei ſuae oculos attollebat ad bona coeleſtia quae deus cultoribus ſuis pro mercede ac praemio piorum labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ſe redditurum promiſit. <hi>Eſtius.</hi>
                  </note> He had Heaven in his eye, expecting a Crown of Glory after all his Sufferings, and that made him walk on ſo cheerfully in Heaven's way. <hi>Being therefore compaſſed about with ſo great a Cloud of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi> why ſhould we any longer count it unlawful, or think it a forfeiture of our uprightneſs and ingenuity,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93499:78"/> to have Reſpect in our Obedience to the Recompence of the Reward? If perſons ſo eminently Holy have gone before us, without contracting either ſpot or ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, or any ſuch thing, in having an eye to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of the Reward, why ſhould we Heſitate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, or ſcruple the Lawfulneſs of following after them? To be ſure, Chriſtians, if reſpect to Heaven and Glory, did not forfeit the Sincerity of a <hi>David,</hi> of a <hi>Moſes,</hi> of <hi>Paul,</hi> it can never prove any forfeiture of your Integrity. For, where the Pattern it ſelf is Holy, and Juſt, and Good, conformity therewith will never make any man Diſingenuous and Unholy. If the Spirit of God record it as Praiſe worthy in others, that in keeping God's Commandments, they had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Recompence of Reward, he will never upbraid us, as Perſons Diſingenuous and Mercenary, for the like holy Practiſe. For certainly, whatever incouragements to Obedience, the Lord formerly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded his People, to this day he allows them the ſame, or greater: So that whenever we have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in our Obedience, to Heaven and Glory, we do no more forfeit our Integrity, nor prove ourſelves Mercenary and Diſingenuous, by ſo doing, than Self-denying <hi>Moſes,</hi> Upright <hi>David,</hi> Zealous <hi>Paul,</hi> and all God's Faithful People have done before us.</p>

For, every one will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the Actions of a Deity to be Indeficient, and confeſs it a thing Praiſe-worthy in all men, to Write after ſo fair a Copy. Now, that Chriſt himſelf had Reſpect, in his Obedience, to the Recompence of the Reward, we find written in legible Characters, by the unerring Hand of that bleſſed Apoſtle, where he tells us, <hi>That for the Joy which was ſet before him, Christ indured the Croſs, and deſpiſed the Shame.</hi> Heb. 12.2. As Chriſt, in the dayes of his Fleſh, did truly and properly obey God the Father, notwithſtanding the Hypoſtatical Union, and the Abſolute Perfection of his inward habitual Holineſs, wholly determing all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency and undeterminateneſs, which ſome School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men would have to be conſtitutive of Liberty: Why, ſo if we conſider him as Man, <q rend="inline">He was to have Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Comforts, and Humane Incouragements, in all his Obedience, that the Frailties of his Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, being relieved with ſuch Spiritual Cordials, he might the more Cheerfully go through with the great work of our Redemption, which the Father had giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him to finiſh.</q> 
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. Hence we find God the Father in that Federal Tranſaction, that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Him and God the Son, from all Eternity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Redemption of Loſt Man, Indenting with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and promiſing him, in caſe he would undertake the Work, both a bleſſed Succeſs therein, and alſo, to Crown him afterward, with an everlaſtingly Glorious Reward. In caſe he would make his Soul an Offering for Sin, then the Lord promiſes, <hi>That he ſhall ſee his Seed, and prolong his
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93499:79"/> dayes, and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand.</hi> He ſhall not Labour in vain, nor ſpend his Strength for naught, and in vain, but ſhall be ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſucceſsful in the diſcharge of his Mediatory Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that we ſhall obtain thereby, an everlaſting Kingdom, and find his Sufferings like a fruitful womb, bringing forth many Sons and Daughters unto God. In caſe he would bear the Iniquities of the People, then the Lord promiſes, that he ſhall <hi>ſee of the Travail of his Soul and be ſatisfied,</hi> and ſhall be abundantly well pleaſed with all his Sufferings, and all his bitter Agonies, they ſhall turn to moſt ſweet Satisfaction, when the Lord being reconciled to loſt Sinners, and their Souls everlaſtingly Saved, he himſelf ſhall ſit <hi>down on the right hand of God in glory.</hi> In caſe, (to be ſhort) he ſhall <hi>pour out his Soul unto Death, and make Interceſſion for Tranſgreſſors,</hi> then the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, to <hi>divide him a portion with the great, and that he will cauſe him to divide the Spoil with the Strong.</hi> Chriſt ſhall not always be held a Captive of Death, but having ſatisfied divine Juſtice, he had the Promiſe, for his incouragement, of a glorious Victory, and of an everlaſting joyful Triumph over all his Enemies. So that, that which made the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. drink ſo cheerfully of the Brook in the way, was the Aſſurance he had to lift up his Head with everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rejoycing. That which made him ſo cheerfully humble himſelf, and become of no Reputation amongſt men, (<hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7.) was the Aſſurance which he had, that God at length would <hi>moſt highly exalt him; and give him a name above every name.</hi> That, in a word, which made him ſo cheerfully Suffer, <hi>induring the Croſs, and deſpiſing the Shame,</hi> was the Aſſurance which he had, that <hi>having once ſuffered in the Fleſh, he ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Heaven, and there ſit down upon a Throne of Glory,</hi> Luke, 24.26. And, ſhall we then, that are the Members of his Body, be afraid to imitate Chriſt
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93499:80"/> our Head, thinking it unlawful, to have Reſpect, in our Obedience, to Heaven and Glory, when the Lord Jeſus himſelf, that indeficient Pattern of all Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, hath done the ſame before us, leaving us an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that we ſhould follow his Steps? 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. <hi>[Sancta Chriſti vita eſt perfectiſſima virtutum idea: omnis Chriſti actio eſt etiam noſtra inſtitutio.</hi> Gerha. Med. 30.] Jeſus Chriſt is the Rule, according to which we muſt Walk; He is the Copy, according to which, we are to Write; He is the grand Pattern, according to which, we muſt indeavour to Live. God's People, they muſt never be followed, without a <hi>Quatenus,</hi> any further than they follow Chriſt: But now Chriſt muſt be followed, without any ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo, we may follow him <hi>ad caecam obedientiam,</hi> and yet never miſcarry; ſo long as we walk as He walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we are ſtill taking Steps towards Heaven and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The beſt of God's People, they are like the Pillar of Cloud, that went along with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in which there was a dark ſide, and a light ſide; the light ſide of the Cloud we may follow, but not the dark ſide: But now Chriſt is a Sun of Righteouſneſs, always ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with ſuch ſpotleſs, and unblemiſhable Splendor, that walking in his Light, we need never be afraid of enveloping ourſelves in the darkneſs of any Sin. The Works of Chriſt are our Rule, as well as his Word; his Actions were a living Decalogue, clearly Paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon the whole Mind of God therein; his Life was a conſtant Exercitation of the Power of Godlineſs; and all his Performances, they were nothing elſe but Religion exemplified, and adorned in her own native colours. Since then, Chriſt is thus the fixed Center of all Righteouſneſs, the Abſtract of all Virtue, a full, though compendious Praxis of Divinity, and the only unerring Rule of an Holy Life, why ſhould we ſcruple to Walk as he Walk, or think we Forfeit our Ingenuity, in looking, for our Incouragement, to all
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93499:80"/> holy and upright walking before God, at Heaven and Glory, as he alſo did? <hi>[Tota vita Chriſti in terris per hominem quem geſſit, diſciplina morum fuit.</hi> Auſt. de vera Religione.] The whole Life of Chriſt, was, and is a perfect Pattern of Holineſs to all Chriſtians: So that we ſhall be ſo far from ſinning in following Chriſt, that we never ſin more dangerouſly, than when we ceaſe to follow him, not labouring to Tranſcribe his Actions into our Lives and Converſations. <hi>Incaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum laborat in acquiſitione virtutum, qui eas alibi quam in Chriſto quaerit.</hi> Bern. There is no way in the World for us to attain unto any Goodneſs, but only through Chriſt: Nor to learn any true Virtue, but only from the Example of Chriſt, in his holy Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, which we ſtand obliged to follow.</p>
               <p>INDEED, we are to know, That though all thoſe things which are recorded of Chriſt, were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for our Inſtruction; yet they were not all of them written for our Imitation. For, ſome Acts of Chriſt were Inſtances of divine Sovereignty and Prerogative, as his ſending for the <hi>Colt,</hi> without asking the Owner's leave, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.2. Some were Acts of divine Power and Omnipotency, as his turning <hi>Water</hi> into <hi>Wine, John,</hi> 2.7. Walking upon the Sea. <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.21. diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſing of Devils, and raiſing the Dead to Life, theſe were miraculous Works, which are the Legible, but unimitable Characters of a Deity, ſo that though men can beſt read them, yet they can worſt write after them. Some were Works of Merit and Mediation, done by him as <hi>Prophet, Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>King</hi> of his <hi>Church, John</hi> 10.22. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. ſuch were his giving of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> redeeming his Church with his own Blood, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1. and interceeding for his People at the Right Hand of God in Glory; which (whatever the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Blaſphemouſly dogmatize to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) is no leſs incommunicable than the work of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93499:81"/> our Redemption, ſince none may take up the Cenſer to offer Incenſe, who have not a right at the Altar to offer Sacrifice? Some (in a word) of Chriſt's Acts, were Moral, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29. and ordinary pertaining to the common nature of Holineſs, which they had written upon them to the Lord in capital Letters, as being nothing but a viſible Commentary upon the whole Law of God. The Three firſt are for our Inſtruction: But the laſt, comprizing the acts of Chriſt's ordinary Obedience, are only for our Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Chriſt bid us not to Redeem the World, to raiſe the Dead, nor to walk upon the Sea: But in the Works of Piety and Holineſs, he ſaith to us as <hi>Gideon</hi> to his Souldiers; <hi>Look upon me, and do likewiſe,</hi> Judg. 7.17. We are always to <hi>look unto Jeſus, the author and finiſher of our Faith,</hi> Heb. 7.26. <hi>giving diligence to be holy, as he was holy; to be pure, as he was pure;</hi> Mark. 14.36. <hi>to be ſelf-denying, as he was ſelf-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; to be upright, and without guile, as he was without guile;</hi> 1 Pet. 2.22. <hi>to be humble, and lowly of Spirit, as he was humble;</hi> Mat. 11.28. <hi>to be zealous for God's Glory, as he was zealous;</hi> Joh. 16.17. And, by the Joy, which is ſet before us, we may lawfully be incouraged to <hi>indure the Croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame,</hi> as He alſo was. For, to be ſure Chriſtians, in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt, the only authentick Rule of Righteouſneſs, you can never do any unrighteous Action. In imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Chriſt the Holy One of God, looking in all your Obedience at Heaven and Glory, as he did before you, you can never become unholy. The Life of Chriſt is a fair Copy, without any Blot or uneven Letter in it: So that indeavouring to Write after him, you can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come under the Blot of being Diſingenuous, and Mercenary in the Service of God. Let Chriſt be the Rule, by which you draw the Lines of all your Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and then they will never prove crooked or une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Let him be the Glaſs, by which you adorn and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:93499:81"/> dreſs yourſelves, and then you will never appear in any other Attire, but what will be moſt Graceful, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and Amiable in the ſight of God. Let him, in a word, be the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> turning about by the ſweet impulſe of his own moſt holy Self regulated Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, both the ſuperior and inferior Orbs of your Souls, and then, though you ſeek your own Happineſs, longing to Feed upon that heavenly <hi>Ambroſia,</hi> in the <hi>Heſperian</hi> Vales; though you fix your eyes never ſo wiſhly upon the Recompence of the Reward, Steering a right Courſe towards the <hi>Tarteſian</hi> Shore of eternal Reſt, yet your motion can never be excentrical, nor irregular.<note n="*" place="bottom">Chriſtiani a Chriſto nomen acceperunt et operae pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium eſt, ut ſunt haeredes nominis, ita ſint imitatoris ſanctitatis. <hi>Bern. Sent. p. 496.</hi>
                  </note> For, there is nothing more becoming Chriſtians, than to make their Lives a Tranſcript of that fair Copy, which Chriſt, by the hand of his own holy Example, hath ſet them: Nor is there any thing more intrinſick, and eſſential to Chriſtianity, than for the Profeſſors thereof to walk, as Chriſt himſelf walked.

The very name of a Chriſtian is ſo appoſite and ſignificant, that it doth ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interpret, and clearly comment upon his Eſſence, teaching us, that the Epitome of Religion, the Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of true Piety, the Quint-eſſence of real Holineſs, the Compendium of all Virtues, and the whole Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a Chriſtian, is to have the Signature of Chriſt's Holineſs upon his Soul, indeavouring to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs in his Life, the Virtues of the Lord Jeſus. And certainly, ſince our Chriſtianity doth mainly ſtand in Conformity with Chriſt, we can never make a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of it, nor be Impeached of Mercinarineſs, in
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93499:82"/> looking at heavenly Glory, as He did, whilſt we walk in Obedience before God on Earth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>WE may lawfully have Reſpect, in our Obedience, to the Recompence of Reward, becauſe the Lord doth frequently incourage his People, by the conſideration of eternal Glory, to all Dutiful, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright walking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore himſelf.</hi> As God affords his people Happineſs at the end, ſo he allows them Comfort in the way of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſweetning all his Commandments with Promiſes, and incouraging to all upright and holy walking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore himſelf, by giving his People the Aſſurance of an everlaſtingly glorious Reward. God doth not exact Obedience from his People, upon terms of abſolute Sovereignty, but upon terms of Bounty, and remune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Goodneſs. He doth not appoint them their Work, and hide from them the Reward: But, to make them go through with it the more Cheerfully, he often tells them of the Reward, wherewith, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving finiſhed their Courſe, they ſhall eternally be Crowned. As God gives the beſt Wages to thoſe who are his Servants, ſo He likewiſe holds out the beſt Incouragements to draw us into his Service, and to make us willing to Spend and be Spent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Man is a Rational Creature, and of ſuch a Sequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Temper, that fetching your Arguments out of the Topicks of Profit and Pleaſure, you may carry him whither you will: And therefore, the Lord, who knows our frame, he leads us on in ways of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, by Rational Comforts, and Human Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, aſſuring us, that <hi>in keeping his Commandments, there is great Reward.</hi> Pſal. 19.11. God knows, that Bleſſedneſs is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of every man, the Centre wherein all our Deſires meet, and that no man can wittingly make light of, much leſs give the Repulſe to his own Happineſs: He therefore ſtands, like a faithful Guide, to give Aim to all thoſe amongſt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93499:82"/> us, that would fain bend their Courſe to the ſafe Harbour of Happineſs, and like an auſpicious Herald, proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Mount <hi>Gerizim,</hi> the Mount of Bleſſings, with Wiſdom in the <hi>Proverbs, Hearken unto me, O ye Children, for Bleſſed are they that keep my wayes,</hi> Prov. 8.32.

'Twas one of the Devil's Maſter pieces, when he Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted Chriſt, hoping to draw him to his impious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, that he <hi>carried him up into an exceeding high Mountain, ſhewing him from thence, all the Kingdoms of the World, and then promiſed him, ſaying, All theſe things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me.</hi> Why, thus (with holy reverence be it ſpoken) what the Devil did to Chriſt Wickedly, the Lord doth Graciouſly to his own People: He takes them up into Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> from thence ſhewing them thrô the Perſpective of his Promiſes, not the Kingdom of this World, but the Kingdom of Heaven, with all the Royalties and Glory thereof, aſſuring them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.3. that all ſhall be their own, if they will but <hi>walk hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> before him, indeavouring to <hi>worſhip him in Spirit and Truth.</hi> The Lord underſtands full well, the Frailties of our Nature, and what great Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we are like to meet with in Heaven's way: And therefore he is pleaſed, moſt Graciouſly to draw us on the wayes of Holineſs, by the propoſal of ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as may incourage us to go on therein, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it coſt us. Our Condition in this World is like that of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> paſſing towards the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> we muſt go through the <hi>Red Sea</hi> of Perſecutions, and through an howling Wilderneſs, where we ſhall often be Stung with fiery Serpents, before ever we can get to the heavenly <hi>Canaan;</hi> and therefore the Lord, he allures us by all ſorts of Promiſes, and ſweet In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements. <hi>I will allure her,</hi> (ſaith God, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.14. ſpeaking of his Church) <hi>and bring her into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.</hi>

In the Precept he acquaints us with our Duty, and in the Promiſe he ſhews us what ſhall be our Reward, By that he appoints us our Work, and by this he would incourage us Cheerfully to go through with it, that having the Promiſe of an eternal Recompence, we may never grow <hi>weary in well-doing,</hi> 2 Theſs. 3.13. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.9. Such is the goodneſs of God, that he ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens all his Commandments with Promiſes: And when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he calls us out to any Duty, he incourageth us to the Performance thereof, by the Propoſal of ſome glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Recompence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. He bid us, <hi>through the Spirit, mortify the deeds of the Body;</hi> and that we may not want Incouragement to ſo difficult a Work, he tells us, that <hi>ſo doing, our Souls ſhall live.</hi> He bids us to take up our <hi>Croſs,</hi> not detrecting to ſuffer for Chriſt: And he gives us this incouragement thereto, <hi>That if we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo reign with him.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. He bids us in a word, <hi>Sow to the Spirit,</hi> indeavouring to be <hi>fruitful in every good word and work:</hi> And for our incouragement to that holy practiſe, he tells us, <hi>that ſo doing, we ſhall of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit reap Life everlaſting.</hi> Gal. 6.8. So then, ſince God himſelf is graciouſly pleaſed to <hi>allure</hi> and draw us on in wayes of Obedience, by the propoſal of an eternal Recompence, we may lawfully ſure, having Reſpect thereunto, take Incouragement from it.

Doubtleſs, Chriſtians! 'tis not Ingenuity, but Ingratitude, to deprive ourſelves of thoſe Incouragements to Obedience, and of that Comfort in a way of Duty, which the Lord himſelf hath graciouſly allowed us to make uſe of. And thô poſſibly you may think, that you highly pleaſe the Lord, whilſt you walk on in a way of Duty, without any reſpect to your own Happineſs, yet the Truth is, you do Preſumptuouſly tempt him, as <hi>Ahaz</hi> did, when refuſing to ask a Sign, which God promiſed to give them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.11.12. The Lord knew the neceſſity of giving a Sign to his People in that Exigence, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whereunto, he bids <hi>Ahaz</hi> ask a Sign; but he's Modeſt, he's aſhamed that God ſhould be put upon the working of a Miracle to confirm his Faith; far be it from him ſo to Tempt the Lord, and to queſtion his Faithfulneſs; he will believe him without a Sign, that he will. However, here were ſpecious Pretences, yet the Lord was no little diſpleaſed, that his Favour ſhould be made ſo light of, and a Sign under a pretence of Modeſty refuſed, as if they better knew what was needful for themſelves, than the God of Heaven. <hi>Hear ye me now, O Houſe of</hi> David, <hi>it's a ſmall thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God alſo?</hi> Thus, Chriſtians! when we refuſe to take Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the Promiſes of Life, to walk in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93499:84"/> before the God of Heaven; when under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Ingenuity, and a Goſpel Frame of Spirit, we take on us to ſerve God for himſelf; He bids us ſeek for Glory, and Honour, for Immortality and eternal Life, by patient continuance in well doing, but far be it from us to be Mercenary, or to ſeek ourſelves, we will ſerve God, and run the way of his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, without any Reſpect at all to Heaven and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that we will; why now we weary the Lord, and making light of his Favour to us, we Tempt him, as if we knew better what Motives to make uſe of, and what to ſeek in our Obedience, than God himſelf. For to be ſure we do no leſs Tempt the Lord in not ſeeking after what he hath Commanded, than we do in expecting what he never Promiſed. We do no leſs Tempt the Lord, in creating occaſions of Deſperation, than in nouriſhing a groundleſs Preſumption. We do no leſs (in a word) Tempt the Lord, in making the way more difficult and narrow, than we do in making the way more facile and wider, which leads to the Kingdom of Heaven, than God himſelf hath made it. Be afraid then, Chriſtian, of Tempting God, for want of taking Incouragement from the Promiſes of Life and Glory, to run the way of his Commandments: But never be afraid of diſpleaſing him, or Forfeiting thy Ingenuity, by having Reſpect, in thy Obedience, to the Recompence of the Reward. For certainly, it can never Argue a Diſingenuous, and Mercenary Spirit, to make uſe of that as an Incouragement, whereby to provoke us to all holy, ſelf denying, and upright walking before him. If God himſelf take us up in Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> ſhewing us the Land of Promiſe, the Coeleſtial <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for our better Incouragement in Heaven's Way, we are not ſure to turn away our eyes from the beholding of it.

Surely God never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that we ſhould ſit down ſatisfied without Him, and be Happy by reflexion upon our own Excellencies, as if Life and Happineſs could be found where nothing but remorſeleſs Death, and Miſery keep their walk.

Whatever Grace, whatever Holineſs God's people have, it's wholly derivative from him: So that whatever Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, whatever Happineſs they may look to enjoy, it ſtands wholly in reduction to God himſelf, as the Original and Fountain-Cauſe.

Such a Soul is touched with the true Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of Grace, ſo that now it ſees ſuch an attractive magnetical Beauty in a Deity, that it cannot poſſibly ſettle upon any thing below God himſelf.

For ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>to them that by patient continuance in well-doing, ſeek for Glory, and Honour, and Immortality, God will render eternal Life.</hi> Rom. 7. As God, when he bad promiſed deliverance unto <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Ezek. 36.37. yet tells them, <hi>that for this he will be enquired of by the Houſe of Iſrael, to do it for them:</hi> So, though the Lord hath given us a promiſe of eternal Life and Glory, yet he will have us ſeek it by patient continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in well-doing, before ever he will Crown us with it. In vain ſhall we think to find eternal Life, if we ſeek it not in the firſt place, giving diligence to lay hold upon it. For, when Promiſes have the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion annexed to them, we cannot take any Comfort in the Promiſe, till we are ſure of the Condition. To ſay then, that we may not have Reſpect in our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93499:89"/> to the Recompence of Reward, to Eternal Life, and Glory, which is one grand condition ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Promiſe thereof, is to render this glorious Reward altogether unfeaſable, and indeed to reflect diſhonourable Blaſphemy upon God himſelf, as if he had Promiſed Eternal Glory with ſuch a Promiſe, as may not lawfully be ſeen unto, with ſuch an unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous condition as can never be performed without Sin. But dare we ſay, that the Infinitely Holy God will make us tenders of Life and Glory upon any other terms than what ſhall be Holy, and Juſt, and Good? Hath the Lord threatned that without Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs we ſhall never ſee him: and will he then make diſingenuity and unholineſs the way leading to him? Doth this pure indeficient Fountain, which is always one and the ſame, ſend forth ſuch ſweet and ſuch ſower Water? Is the God who hath promiſed us Life and Glory, Holy, and dare we think that he would ſuſpend the Promiſe thereof upon any unholy and Sinful condition? Doubtleſs, ſince the Good and Holy God hath made a reſpect to the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the Reward, a condition of our receiving the Promiſe of Life Everlaſting, we need not fear the doing any thing unlawful, but may well have a full Plerophory, that what we do muſt be Holy, and Juſt, and Good, whilſt by Patient continuance in well-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we ſeek to make ſure of Heaven and Glory.</p>

Faith layes the Foundation of Happineſs, and Hope builds upon that Foundation a glorious proſpect of it. Faith leaning upon the Promiſe of God, concerning Eternal Life, puts ſtrength into Hope; and Hope looking for that Eternal Life, which God hath Promiſed, pours the Oyl of gladneſs into Faith. That Good which Faith ſees, Hope patiently waits for. Faith fixeth an Eye upon future Glory, and Hope tarrieth for it till it becomes preſent. Faith, in believing the Joys of Heaven, gives Hope a ſight of them; and Hope, in expecting of them, makes Faith to rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and full of Glory. Faith believes it ſhall end in Salvation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. and Hope bids the Soul be patient and wait to the end that it may be ſaved. Faith diſcovering a weight of Glory, makes ſtrong the hands of Hope, and Hope climbing up thereby into the Mount of Transfiguration, makes the face of Faith to ſhine with the reflexions of the ſame Glory upon it. [<hi>Fides accipit praeſentia dei beneficia, vel etiam in ſpe poſita repraeſentat, ac veluti oculis ſubijcit.</hi> Polan. Syntag. Lib. 9. cap. 9. Pag. 3851.] In a word, what Hope
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:93499:90"/> looks upon as future, Faith gives it a preſent ſubſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, reallizing thoſe things to the Soul, which have now no other being, than what is in the Promiſe; ſo that Faith ſteadfaſtly believing, Hope cannot but with Patience expect that Crown of Life, that Heavenly Kingdom, that Eternal Happineſs and Glory which God hath Promiſed. Thus, whilſt we have reſpect, in our Obedience, to the Recompence of the Reward, theſe Graces of Faith and Hope, they are exerciſed about their proper objects; the one believing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Eternal Life, and the other waiting to receive it, which otherwiſe they could never do, but muſt either act irregularly, embracing thoſe objects which they ought not ſo much as to glance upon, or elſe muſt be perpetually cloyſtered up in the Soul, devoting themſelves to an unprofitable Lethargical, unactive Life, and ſo antidating a ſuperſedeas from their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Offices and Labours, before ever God did ſet his ſeal thereunto. For what is the Reſpect to the Recompence of Reward, of which we are now ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but a Sovereign Cordial made up of thoſe choice Ingredients, Faith and Hope, to comfort the Spirits, and make glad the Hearts of God's People, whilſt walking in all upright, ſelf-denying, and holy Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience before him? 'Tis doubtleſs the Firſt-born of Impoſſibilities, for the Soul to believe the Promiſe of Eternal Life, and wait for it as it ought to do, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having reſpect, in all its Obedience, to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of the Reward, which is nothing but theſe two Graces converſant about their Virgin-objects, uniting their ſtrength, and mingling their moſt ſprightful, and generous Wine for the comfort of God's People in Heavens way. So that, whoever aſſerts it unlawful to have any reſpect, in our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to Heaven and Glory, he doth what in him lies to make the motions of Faith and Hope Irregular; or elſe to put out the Eye of Faith, as the <hi>Philiſtians</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:93499:90"/> dealt with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and to break the Anchor of Hope, leaving the Poor Souls to the courteſy of an enraged Wave, to the clemency of an inhoſpitable Rock, to the mercy of an inexorable Wreckful Storm. Indeed though moſt other Graces have Eternity written upon them, living that life which ſhall never be ſwallowed up of Death: Yet Faith and Hope are Graces of a ſhorter date; they are both of them Children of the Promiſe, but not like to be long lived; their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſuch as doth infallibly imply an imperfection in the ſubject receptive of them, and therefore they muſt die in the Mount, not thinking to enter into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> where Faith ſhall be perfected into Viſion Beatifical, and Hope into the full and immediate fruition of God Himſelf. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> (I confeſs) would have Faith and Hope to abide in the Life to come, and alſo <hi>Durandus</hi> ſeems to incline that way: But, though a Faith of Dependance will be in Heaven, giving all the Inhabitants of that New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a full Plerophory, and everlaſting Aſſurance of their Happineſs, yet to believe the Promiſe of Eternal Life, and Hope for it, as now we do, is altogether incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible with a ſtate of Glory. For we can walk no longer by Faith when once we ſee God face to face: Nor hope any longer for Heaven and Glory, when once we are put in full Poſſeſſion of them-As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Hope, which is ſeen, is no Hope: ſo Faith, which is ſeen, is no Faith. For what a Man already ſees and fully enjoys, why doth he yet believe or hope for it? Faith may now lay hold upon God's Word of Promiſe for everlaſting Salvation, and Hope may now expect this Salvation, waiting with Patience for it: But, when God ſhall fulfill his Promiſe, putting us in full Poſſeſſion of Heaven, and Crowning us with eternal Salvation, then Faith ſhall be quite at an end, and Hope ſhall have its full Period. Faith and Hope may now bear up the hands of the Soul while it fights
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:93499:91"/> the Lord's Battels, as <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> did bear up the Hands of <hi>Moſes:</hi> But when all the Spiritual <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekites</hi> are utterly deſtroyed, and we come to the heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> whoſe Cities are Walled about with everlaſting Salvation, and all her Streets Paved with undiſturbed Peace, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.1. then Faith and Hope will be no longer uſeful, but their Office ſhall quite expire. However thoſe men deal unequally with Faith and Hope, obtruding upon them an unjuſt Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſedeas, and ingratefully cutting them off the midſt of their days, who will not allow a Chriſtian in his Obedience, to ſteal by the eye of Faith, ſo much as one comfortable look from Heaven, nor patiently to wait by Hope for the Promiſe of eternal Life. Shall Faith and Hope give way hereafter, the one to open Viſion, and the other to the full Fruition of God in Glory, and ſhall we deny them their <hi>Canaan</hi> here, not ſuffering them to draw water with Comfort out of the Wells of Salvation, nor to Solace themſelves in the ſweet Embraces of Heaven and Glory, their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Objects? Certainly Chriſtians, your Graces of Faith and Hope can never be converſant about their proper Objects; ſo long as Heaven and Glory are not in your eye. You do intercept the expectation of Hope, and draw a thick Veil of Darkneſs before the eye of Faith, when you have not reſpect in all your Obedience to the Recompence of the Reward, ſeeking by patient continuance in well-doing, for a Crown of Life. Since then our Graces will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in their genuine Operations, and not ſuffered to be converſant about their proper Objects, if we have not a due Reſpect in our Obedience to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of the Reward, we may well conclude the practiſe to he holy, and juſt, and good. For, ſurely the Lord will have all our Graces drawn forth after, and regularly exerciſed upon their proper Objects.</p>

               <p>THERE is that Beauty, Comelineſs, and choice Embroidery to be ſeen upon the Body of Man, which doth ſufficiently prove it to be more than the mere Workmanſhip of any finite Creature: but upon the Soul there are thoſe ſignatures of a Deity, thoſe heavenly Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and Divine Lineaments, which ſeem clearly to evince it, to be wholly the Workmanſhip of an Infinite God.

               <p>THE Body of Man is but a Flower ſpringing out of the Earth, that will quickly wither, and return to its Duſt: but his Soul hath Immortality written upon it; its a Bud of Eternity that can never be blaſted, nor wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther away into nothing.

The excellency of our Souls is ſo tranſcendently Great and Glorious, that it juſtly lays claim to our principal care: and becauſe they will never be raked up with our Bodies, in the cold Embers of Death; why therefore hath the Lord made it the great end of our Lives, to work out Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for them, giving diligence to make them meet through Grace, for everlaſting Manſions of Glory in the Kingdom of Heaven. But how can we thus take care of them, or deſign their Eternal Happineſs as the great end of our Lives, in caſe we may not have reſpect to the recompence of the reward, ſeeking Life and Eternal Glory by patient continuance in well-doing to Crown them withal? Can the Salvation of our Souls be the object of our principal care next to Gods own Glory,

Believe it Chriſtians, they that would perſwade you 'tis unlawful to have reſpect in our obedience to Heaven and Glory, do in effect go about to argue your Souls into the careleſs neglect of their own everlaſting wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.

Can you indeed neglect your immortal Souls that muſt either be happy or miſerable, either imparadiſed Souls in Heaven, or damned Spirits in Hell to all eternity? Do you know what Salvation is; how everlaſtingly bleſſed thoſe Souls will be, that may approach the preſence of their God, that may ſee his Face, that may reſt in his eternal em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, that may enter into the joy of their Lord, and drink freely of thoſe Rivers of pleaſure which are at his right hand for evermore?

Who ever is truly gracious he hath Heaven in his eye, and the World under his feet, not labouring for the meat that periſheth but for the meat which will endure to eternal Life. An hyprocrite may indeed be poſſeſſed with a kind of inefficacious lazy deſires after Heaven and Glory; there may be ſome velleities, unactive wiſhings and wouldings in a graceleſs Soul after eternal Life and Happineſs; which are broken by the pre-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of difficulties, and ſo produce no ſuitable endeavours.

That he died for our good, leaving us an example, that we ſhould follow his ſteps, they will readily grant; but that Chriſt ſhould lay down his Life and die in our ſtead, that we through Faith in his Blood might eſcape the Damnation of Hell, and ſo have an entrance into heavenly Glory, they will not abide. They make him like <hi>Job,</hi> upon the Dunghil, or <hi>Stephen</hi> the Proto-martyr under a ſtorm of Stones, a rare pattern of patience in his Death; but as for the Treaſury of his Merit to Life and eternity of Glory, that they do wholly reject. The moſt that they will allow concerning the Death and Sufferings of Chriſt our Redeemer is only this, that he died as a famous Martyr to confirm the Doctrin he preached, and to be an example unto us, that we might walk in all patience and ſelf-denial before God: But as for that expiatory Sacrifice which in his Death he offered up to God the Father, and that full ſatisfaction which he made thereby to Divine Ju tice, againſt this they bend all their ſtrength, as Men that were induſtriouſly reſolved to undermine the whole Work of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to reduce themſelves into the ſame eſtate of hopeleſs and everlaſting unpreventable miſery with lapſed Angels, that are now ſhut up in everlaſting Chains under Darkeneſs. However there is a ſufficiency of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-evidence ſhining forth with moſt clarified Beams of brightneſs, enough to ſatisfy all thoſe whoſe eyes the God of this World hath not blinded, that Chriſt died
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:93499:100"/> by way of Satiſfaction to Divine Juſtice, that he laid down his Life in our ſtead, and that in all his ſufferings he deſigned the purchaſing of Life and eternal Salvation for us. Hence, beſides the ſeveral Types, and daily hibaſtical Sacrifices under the Old Teſtament, all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuring that Jeſus Chriſt was by his Death to make an Attonement for Sin; we have the Holy Ghoſt every where in holy Writ aſſerting this as the grand end of Chriſt's coming into the World, and of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming obedient unto Death, that he might ſave Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that he might make ſatisfaction to Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, that he might reconcile us unto God, that he might impetrate the forgiveneſs of Sins for us, and ſo put us at length in poſſeſſion of endleſs Glory. As the Lord doth naturally hate Sin, ſo likewiſe he is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inclined to puniſh it: and though there be a Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant according to the election of Grace that ſhall be ſaved, yet in order hereunto the Lord ſtands upon terms of ſatisfaction to his own Juſtice, reſolving to have an adequate ſatisfactory price depoſited, or the Captive ſhall never be releaſed.<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Rom. 3.25, 26.</note> To declare therefore the righteouſneſs of God that he might be juſt, Jeſus Chriſt was ſet forth to be a propitiation for our Sins, redeeming us out of the hands of Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice (which once being violated becomes inexorable till full Satisfaction be given) not with Silver or Gold, or any ſuch corruptible thing, but with his own precious Blood, as of a Lamb undefiled, and without ſpot.

Though before the Fall there was a ſweet accord a bleſſed Covenant of Love and Friendſhip betwixt God and Man: yet no ſooner did our firſt Parents preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricate, but this peaceful League was changed into a

To make up therefore this ſad breach, to compoſe this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociable difference, Chriſt humbles himſelf unto Death, that ſo this diſſentious Flame which threatned to involve the whole Race of Mankind in one general conflagration, being by the effuſion of his own Blood ſuppreſt, there might be a mutual Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, and an unjarring indiſſoluble League of Love betwixt God and Man eſtabliſhed. The Socinian I know will tell you that the enmity was not mutual betwixt God and Man, and that Chriſt by his Death did not pacify God reconciling him to loſt Sinners, but only deſtroyed the enmity that was in our Natures againſt God, ſhewing us thereby that the Lord was already reconciled unto us, and ready to receive us into the boſom of his eternal Love.

A Popes Indulgence may be of efficacy to ſend ſome ignorant People to Hell, with more chearfulneſs and ſecurity, than otherwiſe they would have gone thither: but that Pardon which will prove effectual indeed to calm your Conſciences when eſtuated through the guilt of ſin, to Skreen your Souls from the ſcorchings of unquenchable Fire, and to make you appear with comfort before God's Tribunal, it muſt be ſealed with the precious Blood of Chriſt himſelf.

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93499:102"/> them forth thence, ſetting an Angel to ſtand Centinel and to keep them out of Paradiſe with a flaming Sword: but the Blood of Chriſt hath opened that paſſage, at once blunting the Sword, and quenching the flame, that ſo his Elect might have a free entrance into Life, and Glory. <hi>No ſooner did Chriſt give up the Ghoſt but the Veil which parted the holy place from the Holy of Holies was rent aſunder; the Lord thereby willing to let us know thus much, that the Death of Chriſt had removed all obſtructions that might interpoſe betwixt Believers and their eternal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, in the Kingdom of Heaven. As there fell a mighty ſtorm upon the Red Sea whereby the paſſage was opened For</hi> Iſrael <hi>to go out of</hi> Egypt <hi>into</hi> Canaan: <hi>So Jeſus Chriſt was to undergo the moſt dreadful ſtorm of a curſed Death, that there might be a paſſage for us to eternal Glory through that ſea of wrath which was betwixt our</hi> Egypt <hi>and our</hi> Canaan, <hi>our Sins and the everlaſting ſalvation of our immortal Souls.</hi> Like <hi>Iſaac</hi> upon the Altar, we were all of us faſt bound in the cords of our own iniquities, and ſo ready to be offered up in Sacrifice to Divine Juſtice: but ſo ſtrong was the Love of Chriſt that immaculate Lamb of God, that he comes in our ſtead; interpoſeth betwixt us and the ſtroke of God's heavy diſpleaſure, ſuffering it to fall directly upon himſelf; he takes the chaſtiſement of our peace upon him, and ſo offers up himſelf a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unto God, Bleeding, groaning, and dying for our ſins,<note n="†" place="bottom">John 3.15.</note> that we through faith in his Blood might not periſh, but have eternal life.

He thirſted upon the Croſs and would have Gall to drink, that having merited for us the enlivening nectareous Dew of Divine Grace, we might not pine with perpetual thirſt, but be ſatisfied with the ſweet Wine of Eternal Conſolation.

He in a word would be crowned with Thorns, that having laid aſide the Rags of Mortality, we at length might be crowned with Life and Eternal Glory in God's heavenly Kingdom. Since then Chriſt was thus afflicted that we might be comforted; ſince he drank of the Brook in the way that we might lift up our Heads with everlaſting Joy; ſince his Soul was ſorrowful unto Death that we might receive the reward of Eternal Life; ſince he came into the World for our ſakes enduring the Croſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing the Shame, for this very end that we at length might be crowned with eternity of heavenly Glory; what incongruity can you think it, to have reſpect in our obedience to the recompence of the reward?

I read of a certain Young Gallant that having received a Wound in the Wars whereof he came halt home, his Mother told him, Son, this Wound will make you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Virtue every ſtep that you take: To be ſure Chriſtian, ſince Chriſt was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, purchaſing Life and Eternal Glory for us by the Price of his own Blood, this may well make us think of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven every ſtep that we take in the way of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. Not frequently to make glad our Hearts with the ſweet Meditation of Eternal Life, not often to dwell upon it in our Thoughts, taking encouragement therefrom to all holy and ſelf-denying and upright walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the Lord, what leſs could it be than to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value the precious purchaſe of Chriſt's deareſt Blood, and to make light of that great Salvation which he by his Death and Sufferings hath procured for us? True, it is not ſo much Heaven itſelf the Purchaſe of Chriſt's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Blood, as that unfathomable Love which made him Purchaſe it for us at ſo dear a Price, that ſhould be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of us, and conſtrain us to obedience: but doubtleſs unleſs we fix our Eyes upon the recompence of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, conſidering how glorious the Kingdom, how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marceſſible the Crown, and how entranſing the Joy is which Chriſt our Redeemer hath provided for us, we ſhall never be able to take a due eſtimate of the Love of Chriſt in all its dimenſions. The beſt way to know what is the heigth and the depth, the length and the breadth of the Love of Chriſt to our Souls is often to be conſidering how great things he hath done for us; to what a contemptible Birth, to what a miſerable Life, to what a lamentable Death, he humbled himſelf to Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Life and Eternity of heavenly Glory for us. And ſurely Chriſtians, as Heaven and Glory muſt needs make us ſtand admiring that Love of Chriſt which provided them for us: why ſo the Love of Chriſt which made him willing to ſuffer, and bleed, and die, that our Souls might live and be eternally bleſſed, it will make us more
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:93499:106"/> highly to value the recompence of Eternal Life. That Inheritance of Saints in Light is of itſelf moſt glorious, and above all things in the World to be deſired: but when we conſider that it is a purchaſed Poſſeſſion, and that our Evidences for it are ſealed with the Precious Blood of Chriſt as of a Lamb undefiled and without ſpot, this will wonderfully enhance the Price of it, and cauſe it to ſhine forth with greater Oriency, Luſtre, and Glory in our Eyes. Should a Wife receive from her Husband in his abſence a Rich Jewel, as a pledge of his Hearts Love to her, which he purchaſed for her with the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of his own Life, how highly would ſhe prize it, and how often with delight, would ſhe look upon it! Believe it Chriſtians, Eternal Life is that rich Jewel, that Pearl of great Price, which Chriſt the Husband of your Souls hath purchaſed for you; not with Silver, nor Gold, nor any ſuch corruptible things, but with his own precious Blood: and therefore ſo far is it from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unlawful to have reſpect unto it, that if you do not very highly eſteem of it, and often with delight in your Obedience caſt an Eye towards it, you do ungratefully come ſhort of the inſtance but now given, undervaluing the Purchaſe of your Saviour's Blood.</p>

The Man who provides not food for his own ſuſtenance can never preſerve Life: Thus in vain ſhall we think to promote God's Glory and preſerve that, if we labour not for the<note n="†" place="bottom">Joh. 6.27.</note> meat which will endure to eternal Life.

Let Men pretend never ſuch Hyperboles of love to God, and Tranſports of Zeal for his Glory, yet if they will go on in a voluntary neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of life and eternal ſalvation, never ſeeking after them by patient continuance in welldoing, they do certainly make forfeiture of all their pretended Zeal, as Men that do even embezel God's Honour, and fall ſhort of his Glory. For no Man can rightly aim at God's Honour and Glory as his ultimate end, who doth not alſo intend the beatifical viſion of God and everlaſting communion with him in the Kingdom of Heaven, as his greateſt

Neither do thoſe rare and almoſt unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelable inſtances of Zeal for God's Glory in <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> any thing prejudice, but rather eſtabliſh and add ſtrength to this reaſon, whilſt ambitious to expreſs an Hyperbole of love to God, if ſuch a thing may be, and how much they were affected with his Glory, they do it by a certain velleity, or a kind of incompleat willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be divorced from ſomething of their own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, rather than that the Lord Jehovah ſhould ſuffer any thing in Point of Honour, thereby fully aſſuring us, that next to God's Glory their own welfare and eternal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation was moſt precious in their Eyes. And truly had they not firſt made Choice of God as their happineſs and reward, they would never have been ſo tender of his Honour, deſiring with ſuch an holy ambition to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote his Glory. For 'tis only the hope of everlaſting communion with God in Heaven firmly botomed upon our intereſt in him, that can beget a true Zeal for God, and make us willing to Sacrifice all our intereſts on Earth, how precious, and dear ſoever, to his Glory. Men like <hi>Jehu,</hi> may go far, and pretend much for God and his Glory, till the Lord's intereſt and their own fall aſunder: But they only will run the hazard of loſing all,<note n="(k)" place="bottom">Acts 20.24.</note> and moſt zealouſly contend for God's Glory in this Interim of Mortality, who do moſt earneſtly ſeek after Glory Honour, and Bleſſed immortality in the life to come.

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> The Doctrin branched forth into ſeveral uſes, and proſecuteth the firſt by way of Information in Four Particulars.</head>
               <p n="4">(4) AND laſtly, having hitherto given you to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand in ſeveral particulars, what it is to have a reſpect to the recompence of the reward, how you are to do ſo, and withall let you know the arguments evincing the lawfulneſs of ſuch a practice, there is now only remaining the practical improvement of the Doctrine by way of uſe and application, which indeed is the life of all Doctrinal diſcourſes, bringing every thing home to the Soul in a cloſe and particular accommodation, and therefore more longly to be inſiſted upon. For as the Sun in the firmament of Heaven hath a twofold virtue, the one of illumination, whereby ſending forth its beams of light it guides this lower part of the World; and the other of influence, whereby it communicates itſelf to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Bodies covering them all over with its<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Tim. 3.16.</note> healing wings: So in every portion of holy Writ there is an illumination of truth upon the mind and underſtanding, and withall there is an influence of Grace and Goodneſs upon the Will and Affections. As therefore I have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſhewed you the light of truth, for the irradiating of your minds in the doctrinal part of my Text; ſo in the next place I am to make ſome uſe of the words, that they may ſhed forth their influence of Grace upon your Hearts, covering them all over with their healing virtue. And truly the Doctrine obſerved from the words, is like a box of precious oyntment, which in the Application I ſhall endeavour to break, that it may ſend forth a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual fragrancy, and a ſweet ſmelling ſavor to refreſh
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:93499:109"/> your Souls. 'Tis not an empty Vine, but a Tree of life richly laden with fruits of Paradiſe, which I ſhall now in the practical improvement of it, endeavour ſo to ſhake, that unloading all its precious Fruits into your own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms, it may feed and enrich your Souls to eternal life. The Lord having planted a Garden Eaſtward in <hi>Eden</hi> for our firſt Parents, he cauſed a River to go out of <hi>Eden</hi> to water<note n="†" place="bottom">Gen. 2.10.</note> the Garden, from whence it parted itſelf and became into four heads. Holding reſemblance herewith, if your Souls be the Garden of God, my Doctrine is a River of life proceeding from the <hi>Eden</hi> of the Text, from whence alſo to Water your Souls and make them fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as the Garden of God, it divideth it ſelf into four Heads, in the uſe of it yeilding us matter of Information, Reprehenſion, Exhortation, and Conſolation.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) THEN by way of Information, ſince that it is thus lawful for us to have reſpect in all our obedience to the recompence of the reward, this may well ſatisfy us concerning the truth of theſe enſuing Corollaries. As</p>
               <p n="1">(1) <hi>THIS may give us to underſtand that its no argument of inſincerity, nor any juſt forfeiture of a Chriſtians uprightneſs and ingenuity for him to have an eye in his obedience to the recompence of the reward.</hi> A Chriſtian in ſeeking after Heaven and Glory in all his obedience, he doth nothing but what is holy and juſt, and good, which doubtleſs can never make him unholy, nor be any juſt forfeiture of his uprightneſs, and integrity in the ſight of God. You may as well extract droſs out of the pureſt Gold, and dregs out the moſt refined Spirits, as a Chriſtian may become diſingenuous and contract upon himſelf the guilt of hypocriſy by having an eye in his obedience to the recompence of the reward. Indeed I Read of many in holy Writ,<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Tim. 4.10.</note> cenſured as mercenaries and ſtigmatized for groſs hypocrites, becauſe they were wholly acted
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93499:110"/> in God's ſervice by ſiniſter ends, and worldly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, ſerving the Lord not for love but for loaves, for eſteem of Men, ſecular Advantages, Honours, Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp; earthly Emoluments, together with the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal accommodations: But that a Man ſhould be impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched of inſincerity, and branded for a Mercenary, a Legaliſt, an Hypocrite, becauſe acted in the ways of God by a deſire after the full enjoyment of God in Glory, ſeeking Heaven and Happineſs, ſeeking Life, Immortality, and eternal ſalvation by patient continuance in welldoing, this never could I find recorded in God's ſacred Oracles. Live not then Chriſtian any longer upon ſelf-created Racks, let not thy Countenance be ſad from day to day, ſuffer not any groundleſs ſorrow to have Dominion over thee, as if thou delighteſt in nothing but to make thy Soul a map of miſery, neither let thy Heart any longer be filled with fears, and jealouſies, and perplexing thoughts about thy own ſincerity, cenſuring thy ſelf for that, wherein God did never yet condemn, but always juſtifie thee!

'Tis of dangerous conſequence for a Chriſtian, as to make thoſe things evidences of Sincerity, ſo to make thoſe things ſigns of Hypocriſie, which God never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be ſuch. If the Lord have any where made it the diſtinctive Character of an Hypocrite, to have an Eye in his obedience to Heaven and Glory, then indeed you might well make ſad inferences againſt, and paſs hard cenſures upon your ſelves: But if otherwiſe, you find the Lord commanding you to do ſo, and have the practice of the moſt eminently Holy and Upright of all God's People, plainly paraphraſing upon that Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for your better ſatisfaction, oh then take heed that you be not raſh to conclude hard things againſt your ſelves, becauſe you cannot but have an Eye in all your obedience to the recompence of Eternal Life, leſt you be found reflecting diſhonour thereby upon God himſelf, and blaſpheming againſt the Generation of his Children!

However, would they but ſet reaſon a work, they might at leaſt from that Crown of Glory, that Heavenly Kingdom, that recompence of Eternal Life which God's people have always in their Eye, ſatiſfy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that Chriſtianity is no ſuch diſconſolate penſive kind of Life as they ſhamefully, to the reproach of

The Racer expecting a Garland runs chearfully, the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man promiſing himſelf a joyful Harveſt, he undergoes the labour of ſowing with comfort, and the Souldier in hope of a triumphal Crown, he will throw himſelf upon the Pikes, and fight courageouſly: How much more then may a Chriſtian with comfort run the way of God's Commandments, he daily ſowing to the Spirit and fight the good fight of Faith, for whom hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing finiſhed his Courſe, there remains an Heavenly Kingdom, an immarceſcible Crown of life, a full Harveſt of Eternal Glory. If you will but grant Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that there are any delights in Heaven, any true joy in God's Bliſsful-preſence, and Glory in thoſe Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Manſious, any pleaſant Fruits growing upon the Tree of Life in the Paradiſe of God, and comfort in the everlaſting ſmiles and embraces of Jeſus Chriſt, Reaſon itſelf will compel you to acknowledge, that God's people having their eye fixed upon, and walking in the way which infallibly leads to all this tranſcendent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bliſsful and glorious Happineſs, muſt needs for the preſent rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and full of Glory. I dare not indeed affirm of God's people, what <hi>Tully</hi> doth of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and others of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> that there is not one Day throughout the year wherein the Sun ſhines not clearly upon them. This Vally of Tears is full of Clouds, 'tis the priviledg alone of the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be above them. The Mirth that hath no Mourning, the Joy that hath no Sorrow, the Crown that hath no Croſs, is reſerved for Heaven, as peculiar to a ſtate of Bleſſedneſs and Immortality. God's people, they may ſometimes go diſconſolate and be without
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:93499:118"/> joy, as the Wine failed at the Marriage where Chriſt was: But then their Water was turned into Wine; and ſo the bitter Waters of <hi>Marah</hi> which at ſuch a time a Chriſtian drinks of ſhall be turned into the Wine of Eternal conſolation. They may for a while be under a Cloud, but then that very Cloud ſhall at length be diſſolved into a Golden ſhower of comfort to make glad their Hearts. They may be ſuffered a while to wander in the Wilderneſs, but yet that Wilderneſs ſhall become a <hi>Canaan;</hi> affording them many ripe Cluſters of Grapes to feed upon. They may in a word, have a ſad and diſconſolate Autumm, both their Graces and comforts for a time withering: But the ſpring-time of Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joy will again return, wherein all their Comforts ſhall bloſſom afreſh, and their Graces ſhall recover their former vernancy, never to decay, nor to loſe their beauty any more, till ripened into the delicious flower of Eternal Glory. So then though God's people may be in heavineſs for a ſeaſon; yet even then they have the foundation of their comfort remaining ſure, becauſe the Morning of true joy will again dawn, and the Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſe upon them with healing in his wings. After a weary Week, will come a Sabbath; after a time of trouble, will come reſt; after a ſharp conflict, they are ſure of a glorious triumph; after a night of darkneſs, they ſhall have a morning of joy; and after all their ſtorms, they are ſure to be landed ſafe at the Port of Eternal comfort.<note n="(l)" place="bottom">Pſalm. 1.</note> But the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly are nothing ſo; their joy like a bubble quickly vaniſheth; like a flower it ſoon fadeth; like a <hi>Jonah's</hi> Gourd, it preſently withereth; like a blazing Comet it evapoureth and ſpends itſelf in a ſhort time, por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending their Eternal ruin;<note n="(m)" place="bottom">Gen. 19.23, 24.</note> or rather like the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sun-ſhine upon <hi>Sodom</hi> which ended in a direful ſtorm of Fire and Brimſtone from the Lord out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to deſtroy them.

For whether is better, that Joy which will end in everlaſting helliſh torments or that Sorrow which ſhall be turned into joy that can never be taken from us? Certainly (as a reverend Divine now with God once ſaid) if a Man were crowned with royal State, and imperial command of all the Kingdoms upon Earth; if his Heart were enlarged to the utmoſt of all created capacity, and filled with all the exquiſite and unmixed pleaſures that the reach of mortality, and moſt ambitious curioſity could poſſibly deviſe and might without interruption and diſtaſte, enjoy them the length of the World's duration, they were all nothing to the enjoyment of the precious and peerleſs comforts of the ſtate of Grace, but even for one hour, Believe it Sirs, there is no ſuch joy to be found in the ways of ſin: There is no ſuch comfort to be met with in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal delights, as God's people are called to partake of in ways of Holineſs. Can there be a more cordial joy, a more entrancing delight, a more ſtrong and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſolation, than for the Soul to feed upon hidden Manna; to have the ſweet and delicious Cluſters of <hi>Canaan</hi> to refreſh it in the wilderneſs; to dwell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually upon the top of Mount <hi>Piſgah,</hi> thence taking a clear proſpect of the Land of promiſe, a Land that flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

Doth not daily ſad experience let us ſee, how Men will hazard their own lives in deſperate undertakings, make themſelves perpetual Drudges to the Times, comply with every prevailing Faction, throw away their own Mercies, make ſhipwrack of Faith, diſſemble conſcience, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change their ſalvation together with all Hopes of Heaven and Glory for Earth, and Earthly enjoyments?

Your approaching Death, your Eternal Judgment before Gods Tribunal, your everlaſting condition in the world to come, ſhould not theſe things be ſeriouſly minded, and much rather regarded of you, than the husky enjoyments of a dying Life? What (alaſs!) Poor brutiſh Muck-worm will thy full Garners, thy Bags of Gold, thy ſumptuous Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, thy long Leaſes, thy gorgeous Apparel, or thy dainty Diſhes, and ſweet Morſels avail thee, when the great God calls to Judgment, when Death, as God's inexorable Serjeant ſhall arreſt thee, and thou muſt now breath out thy Life and thy Hope together? Will your Deeds and Leaſes, be evidences for Heaven? Will your Riches, Honours, and Pleaſurable enjoyments, be able to comfort your Hearts, when now breaking through the bitter pangs, and dying groans, that will ſhortly take hold of you?

We can hardly form up a conception of our Creature-enjoyments, ſo diminutive and ſmall, as indeed they are: Nor can we be able to reach ſo low in our thoughts as the bottom of that vanity and unprofitableneſs which is written upon them. Moſt Men look upon their Riches, Honours, and Worldly accommodations through a Multiplying-glaſs, which doth ſwell them up far above the proportion of their own magnitude, and quite ſtretcheth them beyond the line of their proper dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:

Do you not conſider that your Beauty, your Riches, your Honours, your Pleaſures, and all your Creature-comforts, are no better than inconſtant fading Vanities, that are
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:93499:128"/> daily obnoxious to variety of changes? What is all your pleaſure, but as a bitter Pill wrapt up in Sugar, which however it be hony in the mouth, yet is gall in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack?

For ſhame then let the great uncertainty of your Creature-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, and that mutability which you ſee to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon them, make you labour no longer for them, but rather ſtrive for thoſe better comforts which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove uncertainty and can never change! Worldly Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence when ſpeaking in its proper dialect will bid us hold faſt that which is certain,<note n="(e)" place="bottom">Tene certum; dimitte incertum.</note> and let go that which is uncertain. Behold then I ſet before you Earth and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: And which of theſe two will you now make your choice? Will you chooſe an uncertain Earth before a certain Heaven? Will you chooſe thoſe Earthly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that are daily ſubject to variety of changes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe Heavenly Manſions of Glory, that are above mutability, and can never change? Or that the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold changes to which all our Wordly comforts are daily obnoxious, may cauſe us to change our thoughts of them, and no longer to purſue them with a doting obſervance! In all the changes to which our Creature-enjoyments are daily liable,<note n="(f)" place="bottom">1 John.</note> this is the great end, which God aims at, that we may not love the World nor the things of the World. When therefore you find your health chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into ſickneſs, your Riches changed into Poverty, your Honours changed into Reproaches, and all your
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:93499:129"/> Creature-enjoyments into ſo many pregnant inſtances of the Worlds uncertainty, oh ſee that hereby you be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed what little reaſon you have to let out your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions upon them, or to fall in love with them! Are things of ſuch a changeable nature ſo much to be prized? Shall an uncertain periſhing World be preferred before Heaven and Glory, which are not obnoxious to any uncertainty, but have ſecurity againſt all changes written upon them? Here Sirs, you can enjoy none of your Creature-comforts with ſecurity, but whether you have Riches, or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, or Pleaſures, or any other worldly accomodations you hold all upon the greateſt uncertainty, and are ſure of nothing: But now making choice of Heaven and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for your portion, you will find them to be beyond the reach of change, and indeed like the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> that knew no alteration. Why then will you rather chooſe to be Tenants at will in your Worldly enjoyments than to purchaſe the Fee-ſimple of Heaven, and unchangable glorious felicity? Oh be not ſuch enemies to your own Happineſs, as to make light of the certain unchangable Glory of Heaven, preferring the uncertain mutable and periſhing enjoyments of this World before it! If you will make your choice, chooſe not for your portion uncertain Riches; but chooſe, oh chooſe the favour of God in Chriſt which is certain; chooſe Heaven and Glory, they are certain; chooſe the Kingdom of God, chooſe that better part, with <hi>Mary,</hi> which is certain, and can never be taken from you!</p>

Oh why ſhould we be afraid to grapple with any <hi>Goliah</hi>-afflictions, to encounter a whole hoſt of croſſes, or to ſuffer any fiery try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in a way of duty, being encouraged thereunto, by that Eternal recompence of reward which the Lord hath ſet before us! The Lord allowing us a reſpect in our obedience to the recompence of the reward, will expect that we ſhould always have an open ear, and an obedient willing frame of Heart to fall in with every work that he calls us to, not pleading the greateſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty againſt the faithful preformance of any duty.

Time was that you could not let a Day paſs you without the performance of ſome Duty, nor any duty, without ſome experience of Gods Grace, and Love and Goodneſs to you: But now alaſs you can ſpend whole Days and Weeks, if not ſome Months, and yet never give the Lord a viſit, at leaſt in ſuch a formal manner, that as God hath no Glory, ſo your Souls have no comfort, no incomes of Grace from Heaven, no ſpiritual advantage thereby! Time was that you ſpent much time in clearing up your evidences for Eternal Life, giving all diligence to make your calling and election ſure: But now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſs you can put Eternity it ſelf to venture, you have left off working for Heaven; a ſad ſign that your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was artificial, not natural proceeding from a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Life within!

In one word, time was that you ſeemed to have eſcaped the pollutions that are in the World through Luſt, to be convinced of the evil of Sin, to reſolve againſt all Unrighteouſneſs, to bewail bitterly your Drunkeneſs, your Pride, your Uncleaneſs, your impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident miſpence of Time, your horrid Oaths and bloody execrations, together with all your Ungodly Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: But wo and alaſs do you not now turn from the holy Commandment delivered to you, and inſtead of going on to reform your lives do you not return to your

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> The Doctrine improved by way of Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to poor ungodly Sinners, adviſing them to give all diligence for an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in this glorious reward, and preſſing the neceſſity thereof upon them by Five weighty Conſiderations.</head>
               <p n="2">(II) BY way of exhortation to you that have no intereſt in this glorious Reward which God ſets before us, give all diligence that it may be yours. What will Heaven, and Glory, and Eternal Life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail you, if you can not look upon Heaven as your Heaven, upon Glory as your Glory, and upon the recompence of Life Eternal, as that which ſhall be your portion for ever? Wealth in the Mine doth no good at all, till actually ſevered and ſet apart for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and uſes; Water in the Fountain is of no ſervice to a Man, till conveyed thence into his own ciſtern: So though the recompence of Reward, be as a Mine full of excellent and unſearchable Riches, as a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain overflowing with living Waters, yet till it be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made our own, that we come to dig in this Mine, and to draw Water with Comfort, out of this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Life, we remain as Poor and Miſerable as if this recompence of Eternal Life had never been ſet before us, 'Tis not a proſpect of Heaven, but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Heaven; not the tender of Eternal Life, but the having of Eternal Life, that will make us Happy. <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf had a ſight of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and yet died in the Wilderneſs: Thus God may give you a ſight of Heavenly Glory in the tenders of the Goſpel, yet not embracing it by Faith, you may die in your Sins,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:93499:175"/> fall ſhort of the celeſtial <hi>Canaan,</hi> and be damned for ever. Sit not down therefore ſatisfied in hearing of this Eternally Glorious Reward, but give diligence now to get an intereſt in it, and to make it your own. Oh loſe not your precious Souls, loſe not Heaven and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Glory, for want of looking after them.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) <hi>CONSIDER, if you get not an Intereſt in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of the Reward which God ſets before us, you are like to have all your Portion in this preſent Life.</hi> You may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly promiſe your ſelves great things hereafter, becauſe your Barns are full, and your Cup overflows here: But in vain ſhall you look for Glory when you come to die, if you ſeek it not by patient continuance in well-doing all your Life. 'Tis no good Argument that your Hearts are filled with ſaving Grace, becauſe your Bags and Coffers are ſtored with Gold. Becauſe the World dandles you upon her Lap, 'tis no ſure ſign that you ſhall reſt for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſom. You may not think to be Heirs of Heaven; becauſe you are the Poſſeſſours of the Earth. For not getting an Intereſt in the Recompence of the Reward now, you are ſure to go without it to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. The good things of this preſent World you may love, but the good things of Heaven and Glory, you ſhall never have. You may have a large Portion of earthly Enjoyments: But ſhall never enjoy the Inheritance of Saints in Light.<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. 17.14.</note> 'Tis no new thing for God to fill their Bellies with his hidden Treaſures, with the choiceſt of all earthly Comforts, who never take any care to lay up for themſelves a Treaſure in Heaven. But what (alas!) will it profit you to have Earth in Hand, if you have not Heaven in hope? What though Riches and Honour are the Lot of your Inheritance amongſt thoſe whoſe Lot is Happineſs and eternal Glory? What reliſh think you hath <hi>Dives</hi> now left him of all his Delicacies, or <hi>Eſau</hi> of his dear-bought Pottage? What pleaſure hath the Rich Fool of his full Barns, or that young Man of his large
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:93499:176"/> Poſſeſſions? What delight hath <hi>Jezabel</hi> in her Paint, or <hi>Ahab</hi> in <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard? What comfort can a Man have in the choiceſt Quinteſſence of any, or in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. Confluence of all earthly Enjoyments, who muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them as his Portion, and can never expect any other Happineſs, any other Portion, or Reward in God's heavenly Kingdom? It may be for the preſent thy Mony is thy Idol, and thou art held in Thraldom under thy own Poſſeſſions, but what will remain of thy Silver and Gold to carry thy Soul through the Storm of Death, ſave only the<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Jam. 5.3.</note> ruſt thereof to joyn in Judgment againſt thee, and torment thee, eating thy Fleſh like Fire for ever? It may be thou art acted now by vain Glory and Deſires of popular Applauſe, but what will it then avail thee, to be admired by thy fellow Priſoners, and condemned by thy Judge? It may be thou ſerveſt thy own Luſt, and another's Beauty, but what Pleaſure will there be in all this, when the Fire of Luſt ſhall be turned into the Fire of Hell? It may be thy worldly Comforts and Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations are now looked upon by thee as thy greateſt Happineſs, but what miſerable Comforters will theſe be, when peeping out of thy Grave, thou ſhalt ſee Heaven and Earth all on a fire, and Chriſt coming in the Flames thereof to take Vengeance upon thee? There is a bleſſed God that could comfort in ſuch an hour, but thou muſt never ſee him! There is a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away; there is a Kingdom that cannot be moved; there is all fulneſs of Joy, and Soul-ſatisfying Pleaſure; but having thy Portion in this preſent World thou ſhalt never have theſe to comfort thee in the World to come! Make the beſt of your Portion here, of your Riches, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and Pleaſures on Earth; for you muſt never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Portion hereafter, you muſt never look to be Crowned with Life, and Eternity of Glory in Heaven! Oh then how unhappy are all thoſe who neglect to get an Intereſt in the Recompence of the Reward, have no Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but Earth, no Glory but what will end in everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:93499:176"/> Shame, and perpetual Contempt, no Pleaſures but what muſt ſhortly be changed into Helliſh, Intolerable, and remedileſs Torments! If you love your immortal Souls, come away from all worldly Vanities, and be ſure to get an Intereſt in this glorious Reward, that your Lives, and your Happineſs, your Rejoycing, and all your Comfort, may not end together! The greateſt Portion in this Life will afford you but ſmall Comfort, of upon good Grounds you cannot look for a better Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after Death!</p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>CONSIDER the Recompence of the Reward which God ſets before us, it's a thing feaſable, and that which you may obtain if you will but ſeek it.</hi> The Riches, Kingdom and Glory of this World may be ſought, and yet never found: But whoever by patient continuance in well-doing ſhall ſeek for Glory and Honour,<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 2.7.</note> and bleſſed Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, God will certainly Crown them with Life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. The Lord is willing to beſtow Heaven, the beſt of Rewards upon the worſt of Sinners, will they but em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it. This eternal Recompence of Reward, 'tis a thing indeed difficult to be obtained, that none may deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe it: But yet it's poſſible to be obtained, that ſo none may ſit down diſcouraged, as deſpairing of it. This Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation would be out of ſeaſon to the Damned in Hell, betwixt whom and eternal Glory, there is a great Gulf fixed, ſo that they are now no longer within the Poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of Life and Salvation: But for you, there is ſtill Balm in <hi>Gilead</hi> to heal all your Wounds; there is an all-ſufficiency of Merit in Chriſt to expiate your Sins; and there is ſtill a moſt merciful Propenſity of Will in God, to Crown all thoſe that diligently ſeek him, with a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Reward. And why then ſince Life is before you, will you die the Death? Why will you chooſe to be miſerable, under Tenders of Glory and eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?

Give di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence then, ſince God ſo freely offers, with all thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to embrace the Reward of eternal Life.

You may cry Brethren, to your Riches, and cry to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and cry to your Friends, and cry bitterly to your deareſt Relations, but not having an Intereſt in the Recompence of Reward, all theſe will then anſwer you as the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi>

And will you not labour, all this conſidered, that you may not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſs when all your Creature-comforts fail you; not without good ground of rejoycing, when all your En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments will avail you nothing?

                  </note> When once the damned come within the confines of Hell, they have then ſhot the Gulf, through which there is no returning again to Heaven and Glory. Hell will not be to the Sinner like <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Whale, when once it hath ſwallowed him up, to caſt him again upon the Shore of true Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: But rather like the Red Sea to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all further Hopes of Comfort, of Mercy, of Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from that place of Torment will be drowned for ever. The Sun may go down in a Dark Cloud, and yet riſe Gloriouſly again beſpangling the World with more pure clarified Beams of Light and Splendour: But thoſe who once go down in the Pit of Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:93499:190"/> making their Beds in Hell, they muſt never look any more, coming out of thoſe Helliſh Torments; to riſe in Glory. The Place of the Damned is like the Lyons Den, where all the Footſteps look forward but not one backward. So that what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of ſuch as go in to an Harlot, is here verified of thoſe who have their portion in Hell:<note n="(l)" place="bottom">Prov. 2.19.</note> none that go in unto her return again, neither take they hold on the paths of Life. For the Arreſt of Hell and Damnation as it will take no Bail, ſo neither doth it admit of any the leaſt Hope of evaſion for ever, but unpreventably ſhuts up the Soul in remedileſs Miſery. And oh how dreadful will it be for all you who now make light of Heaven and Glory, to be ſhut up irrecoverably in Hell, and remedileſs Torments! Oh this is the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis of the damneds Miſery in Hell, this is the ſting and Poyſon of all their Sorrows, that there is now no further Hope of obtaining Mercy, no way to fly from the Wrath to come!<note n="(m)" place="bottom">Prov. 13.12.</note> If Hope deferred maketh the Heart ſick: How dreadfully then will it break and rend their Hearts to be plunged deep in that bottomleſs Sea of Divine Wrath, where all their Hopes ſhall be daſhed againſt the Rock of Eternal Deſpair! That Hell is ſuch a Priſon as admits of no Hope of releaſe, ſuch a Night as ſhall never ſee the dawning Day of Grace, ſuch a black Storm as will never end in a Sun-ſhine of Glory; this hath more Torment, more Pain, more Terrour in it, than all the Torments of Hell. 'Tis a diminution of our Happineſs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy that good which may be changed for Evil, and the greateſt aggravation of our Miſery to lie under that evil, which we can never hope will be changed for good. That which makes the Saints in Glory com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly Happy, and the Reprobates in Hell compleatly miſerable, is this, that the one need expect no worſe, and the other can never expect any better Condition.
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:93499:190"/> As Heaven would not be ſo full of Joy, if not above all Fear of Future Evil: So neither would Hell be ſo full of Horrour, if not quite below all hope of future Good. For to be without all hope of Good is infinitely worſe than the ſuffering of any of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Evil: So that whatever Flames, whatever Wrath is determined upon the damned in Hell, yet all this doth not now torment them ſo much, as the loſs of their Hopes ever to be made Happy. Why then will you now let go your Hopes of Heaven, expoſing yourſelves to remedileſs helliſh Torments? Is it nothing to be ſhut up in that darkneſs, where you ſhall, have no hope at all of Light for ever? Nothing to undergo that Miſery in Hell, which excludes all hope of future Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in the Kingdom of Heaven? Nothing to be plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in that unconfined ireful Ocean of God's fierceſt Wrath, out of which you can never have Hopes of ſwimming to the wiſhed Shoar of Bleſſed Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Oh what will you do when filled with that Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour which ſhall never give way to any the leaſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort? When overwhelmed with that Sorrow which ſhall never be turned into Joy? When ſurprized with that Everlaſting Night of Wrath and Gloomineſs, which will never have a Day-break of Love and Mercy? Oh this, if any thing will make the Torments of Hell tolerable, that they are unchangeable, ſhutting out the Hope of all true Comfort! Here you muſt never think to change Torments, for Eaſe; Death, for Life; the never dying Worm, for the light of God's Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; nor the Flames of Hell, for the Glory and Happineſs of the new <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

So infinitely dreadful is the Wrath of God, that no Man in the World can underſtand it, much leſs ſtand under it, if once the ſtroak thereof falls upon him. And yet a Cup of this implacable Wrath full mixed with all ſorts of Plagues,<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. 78.5.

A Melancholick Man (ſaith a learned Divine of our own) may fancy vaſt and terrible Fears, Fire, Sword, Tempeſts, Wracks, Furnaces, Scalding-lead, Boyling-pitch, running Bell-mettal, and being kept alive, to feel their Torment: But yet all this, if compared with thoſe moſt dreadful Horrours, and exquiſite Torments, which the damned in Hell muſt for ever be plagued with, are no more than a little ſpark falling upon the Hand, to the furious Rage and Burnings of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s hot fiery Furnace! We have heard tell of ſome that have endured mangling of Body, ripping of Bowels, breaking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Wheel, Fleeing alive, Wracking of Joynts, Burning of Fleſh, Pounding in a Morter, tearing in pieces with Fleſh-hooks, Boiling in Oyl, Roaſting upon hot fiery Grid-irons: And yet all theſe, though you ſhould ſuperadd thereto all Diſeaſes; ſuch as the Plague, Stone, Gout, Iliack Paſſion, Strangury, or whatever elſe you can name moſt Torturing to the Body, together with the moſt inhuman Cruelties, and prodigeous Butche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ever Executed by the moſt bloody Perſecutor upon

If the Fire which hath been given of God unto Man for his Uſe and Comfort, be ſo hot and unſufferable in Nature, that it is ſtill reckoned for one of the moſt dreadful and exquiſite Torments: What then may we think of the Fire of Hell, which not, Man who is able to deviſe much, nor yet Angels which are able to find out more, but God himſelf who is infinitely able to invent moſt of all, hath in the largeſt compaſs of his Wiſdom ſought out, to be not for uſe, but for a Curſe; not for the Comfort of Man, but for his everlaſting Torment? There is nothing more painful to the Senſe than Fire; no Fire more noyſome and ſcalding, than that of Brimſtone: And yet hereby is the Puniſhment of the Damned ſet forth, importing the greateſt Extremity of Wo and Miſery ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, that they ſhall have their part in the Lake that burneth<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Rev. 21.18.</note> with Fire and Brimſtone.

A Generation of Men there is, who not able to bear the wholſome Severities of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, do declaim againſt the Doctrin of Repentance, as Legal, and inconſiſtent with the Goſpel-diſpenſation: But believe it Chriſtians, ſuch as thus make it their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to cry down the Practice of Repentance as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evangelical Work, by making you to neglect the Seed-time of godly Sorrow, they would ſpoil you of that Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt of Joy, that full Crop of eternal Glory which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows after. For this obſerve I beſeech you, as God's uſual Method with loſt Sinners, that firſt he humbles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he Exalteth them; firſt he gives them the Spirit of Bondage, to fear, before he gives them the Spirit of Adoption; firſt, he fills them with the Terrours of Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> before he refreſheth<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Iſaiah 61.3.</note> them with Mount <hi>Sion's</hi> Comforts; firſt, he brings them to mourn bitterly for Sin, before he pours out upon them Oyl of Gladneſs; firſt, in a word, he puts into them the Spirit of Heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, before ever he will Cloath them with the Garments of eternal Salvation! So that here we muſt mourn and humble our Souls for Sin, would we ever come ſafe to Heaven, rejoycing with Joy unſpeakable, and full of Glory. And truly whatever ſome ſay to the contrary, we may as well expect a Crop without Seed, as to reap the Reward of eternal Glory without Sowing in Tears. There muſt firſt a Shower of penitential Tears fall from our Eyes, before ever the Sun-ſhine of true Happineſs in the Kingdom of Heaven will break forth upon us.

If therefore you love your Souls labour by Sorrow to prevent Sorrow; by godly Sorrow for Sin here, to prevent deſpairing Sorrow for Sin in Hell What, is it not better that we ſhould break off our, Sins by Repentance, than that wanting Repentance, we ſhould be broken in pieces like a Potter's Veſſel with the Lion-rod of God's heavy Diſpleaſure?

'Tis a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Eden,</hi> a Garden full of all pleaſant Flowers, and I would not willingly come out of it, till I have cropt here and there one, and gathered you an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Noſegay, to revive and refreſh with its Divine Fragancy, your Spirits in a fainting Hour. You have been with us a little upon the Ocean under all thoſe Storms and rageful Tempeſts, which will beat upon ſuch for ever, as have no right to the recompence of the Reward: But ſuppoſing your claim to this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward good, your right unqueſtionable, and evidences without flaw, I ſhall now endeavour to lodge you in the peaceful and wiſhed Harbour of Divine Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And truly here is a River, the ſtreams whereof (if any thing) will make glad the City of our God. The
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:93499:221"/> Well I confeſs is deep, but yet through the Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters aſſiſtance, you lending the Bucket of your Faith, I doubt not but we may draw Water, Water of Life, nay the Wine of Eternal Conſolation to refreſh you, to enliven and comfort your Hearts in every Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. What Wilderneſs need terrify thee, having <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> ſo plain before thee? What Storms can diſturb thy peace, being come within Ken of thy Eternal Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour? Oh think with thy ſelf dear Chriſtian, what Afflictions need diſcourage thee, having always in thy Eye ſuch a far more exceeding and Eternal weight of Glory? This Doctrine drops Balm for the healing of wounded Souls; 'tis as ſo much ſpiritual <hi>Manna</hi> for God's People to feed upon in the Wilderneſs of this World till they are come to <hi>Canaan,</hi> a Land that flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with Milk and Hony. Deny not then your ſelves the Comfort of that Reward which God ſets before you. The Lord for your better encouragement ſets Heaven with all the Happineſs, and Glory thereof in your Eye, and therefore let not your Eye upon a pretence of (I know not what) Modeſty or Self-denial be turned away from the ſtedfaſt beholding it. Oh ſee Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that you dwell much in your thoughts, in your ſerious Muſings, in your Divine Contemplations upon this Theam, endeavouring with <hi>Moſes</hi> in all that you do, in all that you ſuffer for God, to have a due reſpect to the recompence of the Reward. Oh let the glimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Heavens Glory cloſe up your Eyes when you go to Bed at Night, and let the Light, the bright irradiations, and Heart-warming Sun-ſhine of the ſame Glory be ſure to feaſt your Eyes when firſt you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, every Morning! Whilſt you live, live in the Hope of Heaven, and when you die, oh ſtrive that you may die in the full aſſurance of Heaven. Get, like <hi>Moſes,</hi> a proſpect of <hi>Canaan,</hi> before you leave this Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; and whether you pray, whether you wreſtle with Temptations, whether you reſiſt unto Blood ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt Sin, or whatever you do, do all with reſpect to this Glorious Reward, and in the ſtrong Conſolation of that Eternal Reſt toward which you
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:93499:221"/> are moving. This is not to be feeding upon any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Fruit, but indeed to be gathering Apples from that Tree of Life which God himſelf hath planted for you. This is not to be Mercenaries, but to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving like ſo many living Stones towards God, as the alone quietative Centre of all your Wiſhes, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and heavenly Anhelations. This is not to be carrying a Portion for your ſelves Chriſtians, nor to be conveighing any ſtoln Waters into your own Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns, but it is to live upon your Fathers own al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, and to be drinking of that pure Fountain of Life, of Divine Joy, and Comfort, which the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> himſelf hath opened for you,<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Iſa. 55.1.</note> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites you to. They do groſly miſtake themſelves, and injure God's Goodneſs, who looks upon the eying of Heaven and Glory in our obedience as a poyſonous Corroſive to eat out the Heart of Sincerity: For if you rightly conceive of it, it's a moſt precious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Cordial made up by the Hand of Heaven to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the Heart of a Chriſtian when deſponding, and to keep his Faith, his Patience, his Hope, his Upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all other Graces alive. Truth is, take away Heaven from a Chriſtian, and you ſtrike him, with all his Graces dead at a blow. For a Chriſtian both here and hereafter, both Militant and Triumphant, he lives upon Heaven: Here by Faith and hereafter by ſight; here by Hope, and hereafter by the full en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of it; now he lives militant in expectation of Heaven, and then he lives Triumphant in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting glorious Poſſeſſion of Heaven.<note n="(b)" place="bottom">

<pb n="370" facs="tcp:93499:222"/> to have a reſpect in all thy obedience to the recompence of Reward!

'Tis not Humility, but the Pride and Vanity of a fleſhly Mind, 'tis not Upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs but Hypocriſy, when Men will not ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be encouraged by God's own Arguments, nor to be acted by the Lord's own Motives, nor to live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe ſpiritual Morſels, thoſe proviſions of Heaven and Glory, which the Lord himſelf hath made for them. Fear not then poor trembling Chriſtian, thy own Sincerity, becauſe Heaven is ſo much in thy Eye, ſo much upon thy Heart, and ſo much in thy Thoughts, this is nothing but that Banquet of Love, that the Lord would have thee always to live upon. Come then oh Believer, for the Maſter himſelf calleth thee. Come, and drink of this Water of Life; come with me, and let us gather ſome Cluſters of <hi>Canaan;</hi> let us take a proſpect to refreſh us of that holy Land! Oh where ſhould a Chriſtian delight to be, but upon the top of this <hi>Piſgah,</hi> this <hi>Nebo,</hi> this Mount <hi>Abarim,</hi> beholding with Gladneſs the Celeſtial <hi>Canaan!</hi> What Pleaſure canſt thou have in an <hi>Aegypt,</hi> in a <hi>Babylon,</hi> in the black Tents of <hi>Kodar,</hi> when God calls thee to walk with him in the Galleries of his Love, to dwell with him in the Suburbs of the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to live daily in the warm Sun-ſhine, in the bright Reflexions of Heaven, and Glory.

Oh think often with thy ſelf whilſt thy Hand is at God's Plough, and thou art ſowing in Tears what an eternal glorious Reward will follow after. The Mariner ſailing in the darkſome Night under Storms and Tempeſts, hath his Eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Star: Thus whilſt ſailing in the Ship of ſincere Obedience under Storms and Tempeſts, you muſt have the Eye (Chriſtians!) of your Faith always fixed upon the Pole-ſtar of Glory, would you ever come ſafe to the Harbour of your eternal Reſt. Like the Urano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope your Eye muſt always be turned upward, view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Beauties, telling the Towers, marking well the Bul-warks, conſidering the ſtately Palaces, and with all holy curioſity obſerving the Royalties of the ſupernatural <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> So long therefore as God keeps you at work here below, oh ſee Chriſtians that you live with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort upon his allowance, ſolacing your Souls every Day, with due reſpect to Heaven above, and by ſerious fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoughts about the Reward of eternal Life which abides you there. Now that your Joy may be full and your Cup overflow, give me leave to ſhew you the Strength and Soveraignity of this Divine Cordial, by acquainting you with theſe two enſuing particulars, Viz.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) WHAT manner of Reward it is whereunto God allows you a reſpect in all your obedience.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) WHAT a due reſpect had unto this Reward will do for you, with what Marrow and Fatneſs of Comfort it may Fill you in every condition.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) I am to let you know what manner of Reward it is whereunto God allows you a reſpect in your obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. And here had I the Tongue of Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, had I the whole Monopoly of fineſt Elegancies, were the Words that I ſhall uter firſt formed for me in the Mouth of the moſt Seraphique Cherubim; yet ſo tranſcendently Glorious is that Recompence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:93499:223"/> which God ſets before you, that my expreſſions though filled up with greateſt emphaſis, and cloathed upon with the moſt full and comprehenſive ſignifican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, would as much come ſhort of making an adequate diſcovery, a full repreſentation thereof to your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, as the light of a little Glow-worm comes ſhort of the Sun in all its Glory. Hyperbolize to be ſure I ſhall in ſpeaking of this glorious Reward, but it will be by Way of <hi>Miôſis</hi> and diminution, rather than by way of <hi>Auxeſis</hi> and aggravation. For whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will undertake to diſcourſe of Heavens Glory, whilſt he dwells himſelf in an Earthly Tabernacle, he will be no more able to expreſs it fully, and to the Life, than that talkative Bird which can ſo neatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the Voice of a Man, will be able with all her borrowed Notes to tell you what is the utmoſt Splendour, Glory, and Magnificence of all the World. The Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> (as one wittily obſerves) not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the helps we have is ſtill for the moſt part a <hi>Terra incognita,</hi> an unknown Land. So that to give a full deſcription of it, in all its Riches of Glory, it's golden Mines, it's fruitful Trees, it's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Fountains, is no more poſſible for the ſtammering Tongue of a poor Mortal, than to compaſs the whole Heaven with a Span, or to contain the vaſt Ocean in Cockle-ſhell.<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Vicit officium linguae, ſceleris magnitudo. <hi>Lactant. lib. 6. de ver.

Truth is, we can no more tell the excellency of a Chriſtians Reward and the Powers of the World to come, by thoſe deſcriptions thereof that we meet with in Holy Writ, than one who had never ſeen the Sun could give you a full account of all it's Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, Brightneſs, and Glory, by the twinkling of a little Star in a Dark Night.<note n="(e)" place="bottom">2 Cor. 12.4.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> though he ſaw not all, yet he ſaw more, than what the Tongue of any Mortal Wight is able to utter.

And if any thing, I am ſure this is welcome news to you that know the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of Sin, that find whenever you would be good. Evil is preſent with you; that groan continually under that Body of Death which you carry about you; that complain every Day of Sin as that which hinders your Communion with a precious Chriſt, diſturbs the quiet of your minds, makes Duty a wearineſs to you, cools the heat, damps the vigour, and blaſteth the Comfort of all your Devotions, turning your poor diſtreſſed Hearts into a very Dunghil of all unclean and noyſom Luſts. Sin in the Heart is like the Leproſy in the Houſe, that would not out till the Houſe was pulled down: Thus though Sin may cleave to you for the whole time of this Life, when once your earthly Tabernacles are diſſolved, now Chriſt comes to reward you, to ſet the Crown upon your Heads, to receive you into Eternal Manſions of Glory, ſo that Sin and your Souls ſhall be parted never to meet again to all Eternity.<note n="(m)" place="bottom">Jam. 3.2.</note> Here in many things we offend all: But in Heaven we ſhall none of us offend in any thing at all.<note n="(n)" place="bottom">1 John. 1.8, 10.</note> Here if we ſay we have no Sin, we deceive our ſelves; if with any Sin we enter into Heaven we muſt deceive the infinitely wiſe God, who never admits of us there till perfectly cleanſed from all our Sins.<note n="(o)" place="bottom">1 King. 8.46.</note> On Earth there is no Man that ſinneth not:<note n="(p)" place="bottom">Eccleſ. 7.20.</note> in Heaven there is no Man that either doth or can ſin.<note n="(q)" place="bottom">1 Chron. 6.36.</note> That Sin which is now

So that Holineſs is not only a means fitting us for, but it's alſo an earneſt to aſſure us of eternal Life. For Grace in the Heart hath a twofold uſe, not only to make us meet for the Inheritance of Saints in light; but alſo to be an earneſt of it to ſhew us how ſure it is; as being nothing but the beginning of Heaven, and as a few clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of thoſe Grapes, or Bunches of thoſe Figs, the full Vintage whereof is reſerved for the heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi>

Now when we find <hi>Peter</hi> under a dark glimpſe of this Glory crying out in the Mount of Transfiguration as a Man in ſome Meaſure ſatisfied, it is good to be here: How can we reckon of any thing leſs than fulneſs of ſatisfaction when we come to mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and unto the City of the living God, to the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and to an innumerable company of glorious Angels, to the general Aſſembly, and Church of the Firſt-born,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:93499:240"/> which are written in Heaven, to the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect, and to the full enjoyment of God himſelf, whom to ſee and love will be perfect Happineſs? Never fear Chriſtian, that thy Soul, though enlarged to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of all created Capacities, and crying out for the preſent, like the Horſe-leeches Daughters, give, give, will want any good thing, when once crowned with this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Soul ſatisfying Reward! The Soul that hath God bleſſed for ever, to be his Reward and Portion, need never complain of want, any more than a Man ſtanding at the Fountain Head, or enjoying the glorious Sun, need complain of Thirſt, or Darkneſs. One Sun is ſufficient to give light to the whole World: To be ſure one God in Chriſt, when fully enjoyed, is a ſufficient Portion to quiet the Heart, and ſatisfie the moſt enlarged Deſires of every gracious Soul in the World. If <hi>Jacob</hi> could ſay it is enough, hearing that his Son <hi>Joſeph</hi> was yet alive, oh how much more may a Soul ſafely lodged in the downy Boſom of eternal Bleſſedneſs, and living with God in Manſions of Glory, ſay, now it is enough, I deſire no more!

Here it is that God's People have their Happineſs, their Joys, their Comforts altogether, and not ſucceſſively one after another, as in this preſent Life.

Truth is, the great Reward of Grace is Grace itſelf, a Chriſtian being never compleatly happy till crowned with an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute perfection in Grace and Holineſs. But oh how happy will this Reward make thee, when all thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and weakneſſes ſhall be done away, when all thy Graces that are now in their minority, and as ſo many Undergraduates ſhall grow up to their full ſtature in Chriſt, commencing Doctors as it were, and taking their higheſt degree of Bleſſed Perfection in Glory! Here Grace is like Gold in the Oar, having much droſs of Sin and indwelling Corruption mingled with it; but in Heaven it will be fined into an abſolute and unmixt purity. This Reward indeed for a little Time diſſolves the frame of Nature, parting Soul and Body aſunder; But it eaſily makes amends for that, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting that frame of Grace, and at length brings both Soul and Body together again in fulneſs of Glory. You muſt never think to be ſo gracious, ſo pure and holy as you would be, Chriſtians, till you come to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Where only the Law in our members ſtruggling againſt the Law of our Minds ſhall have an end; where all decays and languiſhings of Grace ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; where all deficiencies of Grace ſhall be filled up; and the firſt Fruits of the Spirit which here we receive as an earneſt of Glory, ſhall be turned into a full Vintage. Your Graces are now like ſmoaking Flax, in which there is moſt Vapour and but little light; or like a broken Reed that is eaſily ſhattered with every blaſt: But in Heaven it ſhall be turned into pureſt Glory, and made a ſtately Pillar to ſtand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken for ever in the Temple of God. Like the Sun wrapt up in a thick Cloud, ſuch are the Graces of God's People now: But when once the Reward of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Glory ſhall be given them, then their Graces ſhall be like the Sun ſhining for in its ſtrength with moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diant ſparkling beams of Brightneſs. You then that go languiſhing all the day long that your knowledge of heavenly Myſteries is ſo dark and confuſed, your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:93499:246"/> after God ſo faint, your Love to Chriſt ſo cold, your zeal for his Glory ſo remiſs, your delight in his Ways ſo ſmall, and all your Graces ſo full of Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and Imperfections, Oh lift up your Heads with Joy and take Comfort in the hope of this glorious Reward, which will quite do away all your preſent defects, crowning all your Graces with fulneſs and moſt heavenly perfection! Grace in the Heart of God's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple here is like a Plant that grows in a barren Soil which thrives but ſlowly and bears little Fruit: But when once it ſhall be tranſplanted into the heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> there it meets with that proper and fertile Soil which will bring it on to perfection, cauſing every Grace like a flouriſhing Vine to be laden with full Cluſters of moſt ſweet delicious Grapes for ever. Oh then what manner of Reward is this, and how much to be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which will thus change Grace into Glory, and our morning Twilight into a Noonday brightneſs, making all Gods People as perfectly pure, as perfectly holy and gracious as their Heart can now wiſh to be, if not much more! This Reward muſt needs make Grace per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, becauſe Perfection in Grace is the principal part of this bleſſed Reward. Needs muſt this Reward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Grace into heavenly Glory, becauſe the greateſt Glory of Heaven next to God himſelf is Grace per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and bloſſoming into the Flower of unſpotted purity.</p>

There is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed an holy Violence by means whereof a Man may take Heaven for himſelf: But there is no ſurreptitious Violence can enter there, whereby any either Man or Devil ſhall ever be able to take Heaven and Glory from another.

So that whoever will unglorify a Chriſtian and take his Crown from him, they muſt firſt dethrone the Lord Jeſus, and rifle the bleſſed Boſom of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, where the Life, the Happineſs, the Glory of God's People are all laid up.

<pb n="419" facs="tcp:93499:247"/> nor loſe your Life, nor may you promiſe your ſelves an exemption from any ſuch loſſes in the World: But this Chriſt hath promiſed, and you may build upon it as infinitely more ſure than the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> that holding faſt the Myſtery of the Faith in a pure Conſcience, you ſhall in no caſe loſe your Reward,<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. 10.42.

Many there be who pride themſelves, becauſe come of an ancient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and dignified with an ancient Patrimony, ſuch as

Earthly Parents they will expreſs their care of Poſterity while yet unborn, by purchaſing large Eſtates, and making them ſure en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails: Such and infinitely is the Love of God to his own People, who before ever they were born or had a being, did provide a Kingdom for them, making ſure from all Eternity the entail of Heaven and Glory upon them.<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 9.11, 12, 13.</note> For the Children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpoſe of God accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to election might ſtand, not of works but of him that calleth: It was ſaid, the Elder muſt ſerve the Younger; as it is written, <hi>Jacob</hi> have I loved and <hi>Eſau</hi> have I hated. Election and Reprobation being immanent acts in God, are not a thing of Yeſterday, nor ſubſequent to the Creatures acts, as if they had eny dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, but eternal and inconditionate. Whether Man were conſidered of God electing as in the pure Maſs, is much controverted: And many there are both Pious and learned do wholly oppoſe it, making Man in the corrupt Maſs to have been the object of Predeſtination. But how to reconcile that opinion either with the uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rule of Scripture, or the genuine dictates of right Reaſon, I muſt ingenuouſly confeſs I ſee not. Not with Scripture,<note n="¶" place="bottom">Rom. 9.20, 23.</note> which makes Predeſtination in both the branches of to be a pure Act of Gods ſovereignity and univerſal Dominion over all Creatures, wherby he may diſpoſe of them to different ends, according to what ſeems good in his own infinite Wiſdom, aſſigning no other Reaſon to mitigate the ſeeming Rigour of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, and to ſilence all the captious Cavils of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:93499:248"/> Minds againſt it, who think to inſnare God by their Subtilties, than his Holy and righteous Will. Nor can I reconcile it with the Dictates of right Reaſon, which teacheth, that every wiſe, and underſtanding Agent will attempt nothing without the Predeſtinating of it to ſome certain end: Whereas, to make Man lapſed, and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in Sin, the Object of Predeſtination, doth imply, that God firſt decreed to Create Man, before ever his Wiſdom provided what to do with him, and to permit his fall into Sin and Miſery, before ever he determined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing certain about his everlaſting and final Condition. If Man's Wiſdom, which is but a drop to the vaſt Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, compared with God's, obſerve a better Decorum in all Undertakings, firſt, determining the end of his Work, and then accordingly diſpoſing of his Workmanſhip, it is certainly hardly-conceivable, how ſuch Prepoſterouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould ſort with the infinitely wiſe God, whereby he is repreſented, as decreeing the Creation and Fall of Man, before ever he came to any Reſult in his own Thoughts, nay, before ever he entertain'd ſo much as one ſerious Thought about Man's great End, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting unchangeable Eſtate in the World to come. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be in this Controverſy, yet certain it is, that there was nothing foreſeen in God's Elect, as a Motive, or Reaſon, influencing him to ordain them to obtain Salvation, or inducing him to prepare for them, rather than others, the Reward of eternal Life. For God's Will is of that ſupreme Sovereignty, and abſolute inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency, that he need not look out of himſelf at any Qualification in the Creature, for the determining of it. Nor can there be any thing more abſurd, than to make ſomething in the Creature the cauſe of God's Will, as if Faith foreſeen, good Works, and final Perſeverance in them, ſhould either be before it, above it, or have a caſual Influence upon it to determine it, when that indeed is the ſupreme Reaſon into which the Grace of Election muſt be wholly reſolved. Our Saviour therefore will give no other Reaſon, why Goſpel Myſteries were hidden from ſome, and revealed to others: But ſends us wholly
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:93499:249"/> in this caſe to the ſovereign Will, and good Pleaſure of God, not at all ſubſcribing the difference to the foreſight of our Will, receiving, or rejecting the Tenders of his Grace. Even<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Mat. 11.26.</note> ſo Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight! Nor can we indeed aſſign any thing in Man as a Cauſe, or Reaſon upon the Previſion whereof God ſhould be moved to elect him: Since there is nothing of Grace or Goodneſs in any Man, but what God hath decreed from Eternity to communicate to him, and doth graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in time beſtow upon him, as the genuine, and proper effect of his electing Love. That Grace which makes a ſaving difference betwixt us, and others in time, is nothing but the Fruit of God's eternal Love, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he loved us before all time. Hence we may find the holy Ghoſt aſſerting Faith to be the Effect, not the cauſe of Election: So that to hold Election upon foreſeen Faith, and good Works, is no leſs abſurd, than to make the Sun receive its Light from the Day, the Tree its Sap from the Fruit growing upon it, and the Fountain its fulneſs from thoſe Streams, which by a natural emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on do flow continually from it. For ſaith<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Acts 13.48.</note> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, telling us what entertainment the Goſpel Preached found amongſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and as many as were ordained to eternal Life, becauſe they believed: But therefore they believed, becauſe firſt they were ordained to eternal Life: Where the Participle (<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) ordained, is added as a Reaſon why theſe believed, whilſt others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the Goſpel, continued in their Impenitency; and not as denoting any Preparations, or Prediſpoſitions in them to eternal Life, before Faith in Chriſt. For that were much more abſurd, than if you ſhould affirm a young Bird, whilſt yet without Wings, to be prepared for, and diſpoſed to fly: Faith being the firſt Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, preparing for eternal Life, and that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Wing, upon which the Soul takes her firſt flight towards Heaven. More might be urged, but
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:93499:249"/> what our Saviour ſaith<note n="(c)" place="bottom">John 15.16.</note> of his own Diſciples, they had not choſen him, but he had choſen them; and the Apoſtle of<note n="(d)" place="bottom">1 John 4.19.</note> all Believers, that they therefore love God, becauſe he loved them firſt, may well ſatisfie any in this caſe, who are willing to captivate their own Reaſon to the belief of the Truth, as it is in Jeſus. For if Faith, and good Works foreſeen, were the cauſe why God choſe us; then the clean contrary would be true, that we choſe and loved him before he either choſe, or loved us, which yet we cannot ſay, without Confront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spirit of Truth ſpeaking in the Scripture. Truth is, we do not prevent God with our Love, but he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents us with his Love. Our Love is but of yeſterday, and is the Spirit of his: His Love bears date from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, and is the Root from whence ours ſprings. We did not firſt prepare our ſelves for Glory, by having an Eye of Faith to the Recompence of Reward: But God firſt prepared Glory for us, by caſting a propitious Eye of Love upon us from Eternity, that in time he may give us the Reward of Life everlaſting. Oh then what manner of Love is this, that before we had any Being, or ſo much as a thought of a Being in this World, God ſhould be plotting our Happineſs, and providing for our eternal well-being in the World to come! Before Chriſtian thou had it either Name, or Life, thy Name<note n="(e)" place="bottom">Rev. 21.17.</note> was then written in the Lamb's Book of Life, and ſhall never be blotted out. Before ever thou did'ſt, or could'ſt do one ſtroak of Work in God's Vineyard, he was thinking what glorious Reward to beſtow upon thee, preparing a Kingdom for thee, before ſo much as the Foundation of the World was laid! Before ever thou haſt any ſpiritual Appetite to what is good, any Hungerings, or Thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings after Righteouſneſs, even from Eternity was God, preparing a Feaſt of fat things for thee, a Feaſt of Love,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:93499:250"/> and Life of Glory! And oh what a ſumptuous Feaſt, what glorious a Kingdom, what a bleſſed Reward muſt that needs be, upon which the infinitely wiſe God was ſpending from Eternity his Thoughts, and providing for you! If the Temple were thought ſo Glorious, and Magnificent, becauſe as the <hi>Jews</hi> told Chriſt, it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſix Years a building: How glorious then, how ſurpaſſingly Rich and Magnificent muſt the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> be, the Temple of God in <hi>Zion,</hi> that City whoſe Foundation was laid before Eternity in God's electing Love, which was a framing from everlaſting, and whoſe builder and maker in time, was God over all Bleſſed for ever! Though this ſtately Building were reared up in time; yet it was a Framing before all time, yea, from all Eternity. This Tree of Life, thought it only Bud and Bloſſom, and bring forth Fruit in time, yet it was planted from all Eternity, in the Paradiſe of God's ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting good Will towards his People. And do not think that the great God would ſpend his Thoughts from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity upon Trifles, or the Framing a poor pitiful Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from everlaſting: No, you will find it anſwerable to the Preparations made for it; ſuch a City, ſuch a Feaſt, ſuch a glorious Reward as the great God will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to own for the Fruit, as well of his infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as of his eternal Love!</p>
               <p n="11">(11) <hi>THE Reward whereunto God allows his People a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in all their Obedience, it's a continued, and an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Reward.</hi> In this preſent Life we have nothing conſtant; no Comfort, no Enjoyment, no Priviledge, whereof we can always have the actual Fruition, and wherewith we can ſenſibly delight our ſelves every day: But in the Reward of eternal Life there is no ſuch Inconſtancy; whatever Glory, whatever Joy, whatever Comfort, Happineſs, and Soul-ſatisfying Pleaſures that carrieth in it, we ſhall have the actual Perception, the ſweet taſt, and the ſenſible lively Fruition of it, every moment, without any the leaſt intermiſſion. As the damned in Hell have fulneſs of Miſery, without one
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:93499:250"/> moments Reſpite, one comfortable Divertiſement from thoſe helliſh Torments under which they lie, or one half Minutes eaſe to all Eternity: So the Saints of God in Heaven, they have fulneſs of Joy, without any the leaſt moments intermiſſion of it; without any interim of Diſturbance, without any unhappy Divertiſement to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, hinder, or diſcontinue their Joy, their Happineſs, their actual delight in God, ſo much as one moment for ever. Our Comforts in this Life are like the Sea, that have their Fluxes, and Refluxes, their Ebbings, and Flowings; if this hour we have a full Tide, yet the next it's low Water, and our Comforts are withdrawn: But in Heaven it's always high Water with God's People; they have Rivers of pureſt Pleaſures that will never paſs away from them; here they have a full ſpring Tide of Joy, and ſweeteſt Comforts that will never be over. What the holy Ghoſt affirms of the four living Creatures, praiſing God, which is,<note n="(f)" place="bottom">Rev. 4.8.</note> that they reſt not day and night, will hold true of all the Saints when they come to Heaven, where they ſhall not reſt day and night, nor one moment of either, rejoycing in God, and warbling out his Praiſes for ever.

For 'tis not from the Exerciſe of ſuch Graces as a State of Happineſs will comport with, that God's People reſt in Heaven! But from that Difficulty, and thoſe Weakneſſes, which attending our Graces here on Earth, do keep us that we cannot always be in the actual exerciſe of them. From enjoying God, from delighting in him, and from glorifying of him, they reſt not in Heaven: But it is from enjoying him, from delighting

Here you find God like a way-faring Man that turns into your Souls but for a Night, and is gone in the Morning: But in Heaven he will make his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant abode with you; he will ever be letting out of his Love, of his Goodneſs to you; and will cauſe you not now and then, but every moment to be drinking of the River of his Pleaſures! Like the ſight of a Star through an Optick Glaſs, when held by a Palſie-hand, ſuch is our ſight of God and Heaven, and Glory in this Life; we are long ere we can fix the Eye of our Faith upon them; and though the ſight be very pleaſant, yet we ſoon loſe it, our Thoughts wavering through, our Minds Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Sometime from the Mount <hi>Nebo</hi> of Divine Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, we can get a proſpect of the heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> viewing it, in all the Riches, Glory and Pleaſure of it: But how quickly are we forced to come down with ſhame, having the light of all heavenly Comfort hid from our Eyes! Oh but when once Chriſtians, you come to receive the Reward of Eternal Life in the Kingdom of God, now you ſhall have peace without any diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance; you ſhall now get above whatever might inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt your Happineſs; now you ſhall have thoſe refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thoſe raviſhing delights in communion with God through Chriſt, that ſhall never intermit! Here if Chriſt come to our Souls in Love, yet Oh how ſoon is he gone, in anger provoked thereto by our cold welcome that we make him!

The Reward of Life Eternal, its an heavenly Banquet, that will not only laſt to Eternity, but of which you ſhall be feeding, and wherewith you ſhall be feaſting and delighting yourſelves every moment of Eternity. Here our Joy is like ſome obſcure Sentence, which though but ſhort, yet by reaſon of its anomalous punctation, its over-frequent Comma's and ill placed Colons hath the ſenſe perplexed and ſounds harſhly: But in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven we ſhall have the golden Sentence of our Joy ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out into a whole volume of Happineſs, and yet neither Period to put an end to it, nor any the leaſt Comma of interruption, to ſuſpend us from drinking in the ſweetneſs of it, ſo much as one moment to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity! Like a Winter's Day on which the Sun breaks forth, but is preſently over-clouded again, ſuch is our Comfort in this Life: But in Heaven our Joy, our Comfort, our ſweeteſt communion with God, it will be like a clear Summers Day on which there is not the leaſt cloud appears to intercept the warm beams of the Sun, or to hide his light from us ſo much as one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment throughout the whole Day.</p>

               <p n="1">(1) <hi>A due Reſpect had to the Recompence of the Reward, will derive much ſtrength into your Souls, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing them with all ſuitable Abilities for every Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> God's People, though weak in themſelves, yet they are never without ſtrength in God: But when by Faith they look within the Vail, obſerving what Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es es of Grace and Glory are laid up for them there, then they are ſtrengthned more than ever, then they are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted more powerfully than ever, then they have Ability for the Work of the Lord, more than ever. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> though a weak Veſſel, not having Ability, as he ſadly complains, for any Duty in himſelf: Yet having his Eye fixed continually upon Heaven, the Grace of God is ſo mightily with him, that now he can go through eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Duty, labouring more abundantly than all the reſt. Through Faith it was that thoſe Worthies, mentioned by our Apoſtle,<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Heb. 11.34.</note> were made ſtrong: To be ſure Faith eying the Reward of eternal Life, will put ſtrength into you. There is nothing that can facilitate your Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on Earth, but an Eye to Heaven; nor can any thing make you able for the Work of the Lord, but the ſerious Meditation of that Reward which you ſhall have from the Lord. Doſt thou complain ſweet Babe in Chriſt, of thy own weakneſs? Is it thy daily Affliction that thy Soul is ſo dull, ſo indiſpoſed, ſo unable for the Work of God? Art thou daily troubled to think what a Child thou art at every holy Exerciſe; how unable to Pray, to Meditate, to work out thy own Salvation? Fix thy Thoughts upon Heaven; eye ſtedfaſtly the Reward of eternal Glory: Not doubting, but that will ſhed ſuch an enlivening Dew of Grace upon thy Soul, as will effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

Underſtand then ye Bleſſed of the Lord where your ſtrength lies, and how eaſily you may be furniſhed with ſtrength for every holy Undertaking! A Man eying the Prize ſet before him, through an ambitious deſire of it ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſtrength to run the Race: Thus Chriſtians, eying this glorious Reward, will be ſure to gather ſpiritual Strength to run the way of God's Commandments. O Chriſtians, had you but more ſerious fixed Thoughts of heavenly Glory, how would this rally together all the Powers of your Souls in Duty, how would this enliven your Hearts, renew your Strength, and make you mount up with Wings as Eagles, make you run, and not be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, make you walk,<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Iſaiah 40.31.</note> and never grow faint through Weakneſs in the Work of the Lord! Oh what greater Encouragement can any Man have to ſtrengthen his Heart and Hands in every Duty, than to think having fixed his Eye upon this glorious Reward, yonder is the Crown, the Kingdom, the Glory prepared for me! <hi>Sampſon</hi> being ready to faint through Drought, the Lord clave a place in the Jaw, cauſing Water<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Judges 15.19.</note> to come out, of which when <hi>Sampſon</hi> had drunk, his Spirit, his Strength came again, and the Man revived: So Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, if at any time through Weakneſs you be ready to faint, be ſure that you go to this Fountain of Life, drink in ſomething of Heaven; this will be a ſpiritual En-hakkore to you; cauſe a Spirit of Might, of Strength to come upon you! You complain you cannot pray, you cannot perform Duty; you have no Life, no Power, no Hearts in any holy Undertaking: But how much is the Fault your own? Did you ſtedfaſtly look up to Heaven, you could not always like Children be troubled with ſuch Weakneſs. When ever therefore you find In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, Weakneſs, Inability lying heavy upon you,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:93499:265"/> ſo that you cannot do the things that you would; I'le tell you, if indeed you do deſire to be eaſed of this Burden, what you ſhall do; Sit down for a little moment, and ſteep your Thoughts in this River of Life; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in every Duty, it is to Heaven that you are walking, 'tis to the ever bleſſed God, to a precious Chriſt, to all fulneſs of Joy, to a Crown of Life that ſhall never be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from you!</p>

Though there be nothing that lies more heavy upon an ingenuous Spirit, than the Reproaches, reviling Language, opprobrious Nick-names put upon God's People by the ſcurrilous multitude, yet the weight of Glory, when ſeriouſly eyed will make all this light, and eaſie to be born. Though God's People would not for all the World give any juſt occaſion to thoſe without to ſpeak evil of their holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, yet if all the World ſhould revile them malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, traduce them, and ſay all manner of evil of them falſly for the ſake of Chriſt,<note n="(e)" place="bottom">Mat. 5.10, 11, 12.</note> in this they could not but rejoyce, and be exceeding glad, knowing how tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendently great and glorious their Reward is in Heaven; Heaven is ſo glorious an Inheritance, that whoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds it with an Eye of Faith, cannot chooſe but glory in all thoſe Reproaches, as Matter of greateſt Honour, and higheſt Dignity which he ſuffers for Chriſt. Hence <hi>Moſes,</hi> he eſteems the Reproach of Chriſt, greater Riches than the Treaſures of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as having an Eye to this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Reward, which he knew would follow after.

The ſame Author writing to ſome of God's People under manifold Sufferings, he thus comforts them againſt their Chains, and other diſgraceful uſages which they met withal. Theſe are not Bonds, but Ornaments; they
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:93499:266"/> tie not Chriſtians Feet to any Diſgrace, but only fit them for the Crown. O Feet, happily bound, which not the Smith, but the Lord himſelf ſhall ſet at liberty! O Feet happily bound, which by a ſaving Journey are directed to Paradiſe! O Feet bound a while in this World, to be at liberty with the Lord for evermore! All this Deformity, though deteſtable and matter of foul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach amongſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> with what everlaſting Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor ſhall it be rewarded! This ſhort and momentany Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, how ſoon ſhall it be changed for the recompence of bright eternal Glory! So that you ſee diſgrace, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, and fouleſt Reproaches will be counted but as Badges of Honour, when the Eye is fixed upon that Crown to which they lead. If we put the Finger in the Eye, and bewail our Unhappineſs, when reproached, and evil ſpoken of in the World, it's a ſign that eternal weight of Glory that will follow after is not in our Eye. O then that you may not ſuffer your ſelves to be ſcoffed out of your Profeſſion, look well to that eternal Reward which lies before you. O Chriſtians, 'tis not your Shame, but your Glory, 'tis not your Diſhonour, but your greateſt Renown to ſuffer Reproach for Chriſt's ſake; and ſo would you quickly count of it, did you but ſeriouſly think with your ſelves to what a glorious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom you will ſhortly come! Be not then like ſome, whom <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaks of, that were <hi>pudoris magis memores quam ſalutes,</hi> more ſolicitous about a little worldly Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, to ſhun that, than about their immortal Souls that they might be ſaved! Chriſt himſelf was counted a Wine-bibber, an Enemy to <hi>Caeſar, David</hi> was the Song of the Drunkards, and ſhall we think to eſcape, ſaving both our ſecular Repute here, and our Souls hereafter? <hi>Paul</hi> rattles his Chain which he bore for the Goſpel, taking an holy Pride in it: And ſhall we be daſh'd out of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance by the Reproaches of a few pitiful Fellows, whoſe only Character of Commendation is, that they (as <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> ſaith, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

<pb n="457" facs="tcp:93499:266"/> and Reproach in the World for him? O let us count all Accuſations that are brought againſt us for Righteouſneſs ſake, our Glory, and bind every Reproach that we ſuffer to our Head as a Crown of Honour! The Sun never ſhineth more brightly, than when newly come from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Cloud; the more Chriſtians, you are under a Cloud of Reproach and Diſgrace in this World, the more bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will you ſhine for ever in the Kingdom of God. Be it ſo that you are now counted the off-ſcouring, and refuſe of all things; yet the time is at hand, when Chriſt will come to be glorified in his Saints, and admired in all them that believe. Oppoſe then your future Glory to your preſent Suffering; and that when cloathed with nothing but Shame and Reproach in this World, you may glory therein, think often of thoſe white Robes, thoſe Garments of Salvation which will ſhortly be put upon you! Give me my Chains too, and dub me a Knight of that noble Order, ſaid a Martyr of great Quality in <hi>France,</hi> when he ſaw his Fellow-ſufferers bound with Cords, and himſelf for his Dignity let go unbound. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach it ſelf, when ſuffered for Chriſt, will be matter of Glory, if your Eye be once ſtedfaſtly fixed upon this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Reward. The Spouſe is never more beautiful, than when the World counts her baſe, conſtraining her to wallow in Sack-cloath. By all Aſperſions God's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are waſhed fairer; the white Robes of Glory, are moſt ſure to be put upon them, who were firſt ſcoured for the ſake of Chriſt with the Soap and Fullers-earth of worldly Diſgrace. The Reproach which we ſuffer for Chriſt is a precious Treaſure, which though it have weight in it, to preſs and grieve us, yet there is in it ſuch fulneſs of Worth, as will everlaſtingly Enrich and Crown us. You may bear the Reproach of Men a while, but that Honour which comes from God you ſhall wear for ever. Here you may be wrap'd up in Darkneſs, and buried in Diſgrace: But hereafter you ſhall be adorned with Robes of Light, and Crowns of Glory. Now you may lie among the Pots, and be ſmutted with the foul calumniating Tongues of ungodly Men; but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of eternal Life, it will make you like the Wings

Would you therefore have Comfort Chriſtians, and be able to ſmile when the World frowns upon you? Would you have your Priſon be turned into a Paradiſe? Would you, if baniſhed into a ſtrange Land, find a ſpiritual <hi>Eden</hi> a Garden of all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly delights in every howling Wilderneſs through which you may wander?

Oh ſee, then ſee that you look within the veil, fixing your Eye upon that Crown of Life which is ſet before you! This will turn your Sorrow into Joy; this will give you the Oyl of Gladneſs for mourning; this will change the bitter Waters of <hi>Marah</hi> into Wine; this will ſoften the hardeſt Gridiron, that you can be broyled upon, and turn the ſcorching Flames of a fiery Tryal into a Bed of Roſes!<note n="(l)" place="bottom">

That Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which is now revealed to you by an Eye of Faith, ſhall ſhortly be revealed in you, if keeping your Eye ſtedfaſtly fixed upon it, you go on ſtill to ſeek it by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient continuance in well-doing. The good Thief upon the Croſs, having the Kingdom and Glory of Chriſt in his Eye, hath the promiſe to be that very day with Chriſt in Paradiſe. Though now Chriſtians you be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs, and ſorely diſtreſſed; yet if your Eye be fixed upon heaven's Glory, it cannot be much above one days journey betwixt your Souls and the Paradiſe of God; where<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Erimus Chriſtiani cum Chriſto glorioſi; de Deo patre bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti; de perpetua voluptate laetantes ſemper in conſpectu Det &amp; agentes Deo gratias ſemper. <hi>Cyprian. ad Demetr. pa. 331.</hi>
                  </note> you ſhall be glorious, as Chriſt is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, bleſſed of God, repleniſhed with all fulneſs of Joy, and ſhall have an everlaſting Sabbath of Reſt, taking up your ſweeteſt Repoſe in the Boſom of your bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, loving, praiſing, and enjoying him in one eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Soul-entrancing Fruition!</p>
               <p>HOW chearfully then may the People of God under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go their preſent Sufferings, and entertain, when it comes, their approaching Diſſolution! The hope which <hi>Jacob</hi> had to enjoy the beautiful <hi>Rachel,</hi> was to him a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Hope under all his Hardſhips; yet not worthy to make an Emblem of ours, who hope within a few days more to enjoy the Light of God's Countenance,
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:93499:285"/> and the Soul-raviſhing Beauty of our bleſſed Redeemer's Face in Glory! Affliction may attend God's People all their Life long, but only as a Foil to ſet off their future Bleſſedneſs, and make Heaven ſo much the ſweeter. Death it ſelf that bold Purſuivant, will erelong look in at the Windows of God's deareſt Children, but only as their Birth-day to an Eternity of Joy unſpeakable, and beyond imagination! Lift up then your Heads with Joy, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt all your Afflictions, to that Crown of Life that follows after: And while the Thorn of Death is at your Breaſt, ready to let out your Life-blood, even then let your Souls break forth, like ſo many heavenly Nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gales, into ſinging, as knowing that your bodily Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution will only make way for your Coronation in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. You<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Pſal. 126.5, 6.</note> may ſow in Tears; but ſhall reap in Joy. You may go out weeping though you be ſuch as bear precious Seed; but ſhall doubtleſs come again rejoycing, and bring your full Sheaves of Glory along with you. Sorrow you may have over Night, when you have the advantage of the Seaſon to ſleep it out, and paſs it over: But your Joy will come in the Morning, when you ſhall enter freſh upon it, and have before you to enjoy it in, the whole Day of a bleſſed Eternity that will never be over. Your Joys are now mixt with Sorrows, your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts with many Croſſes, and your Light with much Darkneſs: But having finiſhed your Courſe, Death will put an end to all your Sorrows, remove your Croſſes, and ſo compaſs you about with the Light of Glory! When wicked Men die, their Works follow them in eternal Helliſh-torments: But when the People of God die, their Works follow them in the full Reward of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heavenly Glory.
